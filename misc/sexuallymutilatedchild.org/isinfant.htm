<h2><center>Is Infant Circumcision a Moral/Ethical Issue</center></h2>
<P>
<BR>

To <b>Genesis/ASPO/Lamaze</B> (6/21/83):

<P>I recently read "An Alternative Circumcision
Procedure," by Louise and Roger Cox, in your April/May
issue.
<P>
      I would like to comment on their statement that infant
circumcision is neither right nor wrong.
<P>
      Consider what infant circumcision actually means: the
amputation and irreversible destruction of a healthy,
sensitive, normal part of someone else's body, that is
rightfully his and that he instinctively wants to keep
intact, at a time in his life when he can't understand what
is being done to him -- or why -- and can't speak for or
protect himself.
<P>
      Roughly four out of five males in the world reach
adulthood with their foreskins intact. The vast majority of
them keep their foreskins intact, even in societies in which
most males are circumcised. It seems reasonable, therefore,
to assume that the vast majority of males circumcised in
infancy would keep their foreskins intact too -- if they
were given the choice. Circumcising a male before he can
make that choice deprives him of a part of his body -- and
the part of his life he would have experienced with it --
that it's almost a certainty he would rather have kept.
<P>
      (No one seems to know how many males in the U.S.
circumcised in infancy would rather have their foreskins
intact. A low guess of only one percent would be about a
million men. Now that the protective, sensory and sexual
functions of the foreskin are becoming more widely known and
understood, the actual number of men in this country
discontent with their circumcised state is probably much
higher.)
<P>
      If the way the baby will eventually feel about having
or not having his foreskin intact matters to whoever decides
whether he will go through life with or without it, the odds
greatly favor leaving the baby's foreskin intact -- for at
least three reasons: 1) because an uncircumcised male is
more likely to be glad that his foreskin is intact than a
circumcised male is likely to be glad that his foreskin is
missing; 2) because a circumcised male is more likely to
regret that his foreskin is missing than an uncircumcised
male is likely to regret that his foreskin is intact; and 3)
because an uncircumcised male who would rather not have a
foreskin can be circumcised, but a circumcised male who
would rather have a foreskin cannot become intact.
<P>
      Is infant circumcision neither right nor wrong? Ask
the question another way: Is it neither right nor wrong to
cut off a part of a baby's penis that the vast majority of
males who have that part of their penis intact value and
prefer -- infinitely prefer -- to keep?      
<P>
      Considering how many males have been forced to go
through life with that part of penis missing, the answer is
as painful as it is clear.
