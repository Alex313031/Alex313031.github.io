"I'm sobbing. The baby's screaming. The
doctor's cutting. There's blood everywhere. And the
doctor looked into my face and said, 'There's no
medical reason for doing this.'  And that ... literally
changed the course of my life." <b>Marilyn Milos, RN,
Founder/Director, NOCIRC</b>
<P>
"Information on the history of circumcision in
the United States is very scanty, and that is why I
set about doing my research, and I have to this date
amassed approximately 3,000 articles, all of them
detailing the history of circumcision in the United
States. In this country there is a common thread
running throughout circumcision advocacy. It turns out
that whatever disease is the focus of national
attention, in whatever given time period, the
circumcision advocates will use that disease as an
excuse for circumcision ... In the 1940s, when
venereal disease was the focus of national attention,
the circumcision advocates said that circumcision
would prevent and cure venereal disease. In the 1950s
and 60s, when cancer was the great fear of the
American public, naturally, circumcision was used as a
cure and a preventative of cancer. In the late 1980s
and the 1990s, when AIDS and HIV have become a
tremendous problem, the circumcision advocates have
advocated circumcision as a way to reduce the risks."
<b>Frederick Hodges, Historian</b>
<P>
"Almost all of today's medical literature
advocating circumcision has been generated by a small
but vocal group of non-intact males. Could these
obsessive efforts to scientifically prove foreskin
pathology also be an unconscious effort to rationalize
their own mutilation or to validate cultural beliefs?
What is the psychology of a circumciser?" <b>Narrator</b>
<P>
"Are these physicians acting as modern day
witch doctors? I don't know that they took an oath to
serve as agents of a social custom, and yet that's
exactly what they're doing when they perform
medically unnecessary operations on unconsenting
children. When fathers consent to the surgery for their
sons, they perhaps unconsciously are more concerned
about their own genital integrity ... This is a very
serious ethical problem for physicians because how
can they be removing a part of the body about which
they know nothing? ... The [intact] penis ... during
sexual intercourse can glide in and out of its own
erotogenic self. This not only increases the pleasure
for the male but decreases the abrasion and loss of
lubrication for the female ... When you're missing 12
to 15 square inches of exquisitely designed, highly
complex and very nerve-laden tissue from your penis, it
has to effect the pleasure dynamic and the function of
the penis." <b>Steve Scott, NOCIRC of Utah</b>
<P>
"[F]oreskin is very highly innervated and
when separated, that is a serious injury." <b>Ashley
Montagu, PhD</b>
<P>
"Recent preliminary research into foreskin
structure finds it [the foreskin] to be more densely
nerve laden than any other part of the penis."
<b>Narrator</b> 
<P>
"[T]here have been no major studies, no
large-scale studies, no really analytic studies that I
know anything about, to prove what the consequences
might be, later in life, from infant circumcision." <b>David
Chamberlain, PhD, Association for Pre- and
Perinatal Psychology and Health</b>
<P>
"In almost all cultures where female
mutilation occurs, male mutilation is also widespread."
<b>Narrator</b>
<P>
"When they're told that ... approximately
60 percent of the boys born here are circumcised,
they're shocked, because Europeans generally consider
male mutilation in the same category as female genital
mutilation, an attack by some superstitious individual
with a knife on the genitals of young children." <b>James
DeMeo, PhD, cultural anthropologist</b>
<P>
"[B]ecause he's not familiar with the
orgasm that he [would have been] able to have with a
foreskin, what he has is normal [to him]." <b>Hanny
Lightfoot-Klein, American Board of Sexology</b>
<P>
"This is probably the last imprint I made on
this planet as a whole human being." <b>Duane Jorde,
NOHARMM and NORM of Hawaii</b>, NOHARMM rally,
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine,
Washington, D.C., May 1994, just before tearing up
and burning his birth certificate imprinted with his
baby foot prints.

"What we're doing, it's not radical at all. It's
common sense. It's sanity." <b>Betty Katz Sperlich, RN.,
conscientious objector to circumcision</b>
