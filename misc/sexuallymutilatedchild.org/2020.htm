<b>"The Unkindest Cut," <I>20/20</I>, ABC-TV, 
January 22, 1999</b>

Like most other reports about circumcision, this report failed 
to acknowledge the one consideration that makes all other
considerations irrelevant: 

<ul>

that circumcision without consent of the circumcised (the 
circumcision of children and babies) is foreskin amputation by
force and therefore a Human Rights violation, not a medical
issue -- for exactly the same reason cutting any other healthy, 
normal, functional part of another person's body off without his 
or her consent would be a Human Rights violation, not a medical issue.

</ul>

The report failed to mention many other facts and considerations
that an honest report would have included, including the following:

<ul>

<li>The foreskin is erogenous tissue. 

<li>The vast majority of intact males value their wholeness -- 
even beyond price -- and wouldn't want to be circumcised even if 
<I>all</I> the alleged medical benefits of circumcision were real.

<li>Many circumcised males bitterly resent that someone cut part
of their penis off when they were too young to protect themselves.

<li>Babies are as sensitive to pain as anyone else -- if not
more so.

<li>Most babies are given no anesthetic when they are
circumcised.

<li>Anesthetics don't always work and are never 100% effective.

<li>Having a needle stuck into his penis is itself painful for
a baby.

<li>From the baby's point of view, having his foreskin torn 
from his glans and cut off is torture.

<li>Babies have had their entire penises burned off while being
circumcised and then been surgically changed into "girls."

<li>Males circumcised as adults have reported losses of
as much as 90% of their ability to experience sexual sensation 
after being circumcised, 
as well as inability to get or to maintain an erection, difficulty 
ejaculating, and inability to ejaculate. 

<li>Growing numbers of women are reporting a strong preference
for intact partners.

<li>Thousands of circumcised men have re-covered -- and thousands
more are in the process of re-covering -- their denuded glans by 
various stretching and surgical techniques.

<li>The marketing and trafficking of foreskins stolen from human 
babies is a multi-million-dollar-a-year racket.

</ul>

-- all facts that ABC had to be aware of and all, therefore, 
documentation by their absence of ABC's attempt to deceive its 
viewers.

<P>The report didn't even mention that some babies <I>die</I> as a 
result of circumcision.

<P>Barbara Walters misquoted the 
<a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap/">
American Academy of Pediatrics
1989 <I>Report of the Task Force on Circumcision</I></a> when she
stated: "In 1989 the American Academy of Pediatrics said that 
there <i>were</I> medical benefits of circumcision." The
<I>Report</I> really states: "Newborn circumcision has
<I>potential</I> medical benefits and advantages <I>as well as 
disadvantages and risks</I>." [Emphasis added.] Barbara Walters 
omitted "potential" and "disadvantages and risks."
