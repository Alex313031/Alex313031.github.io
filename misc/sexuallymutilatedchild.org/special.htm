The July-August 1998 issue of the American edition of <I>Men's
Health</I>
("Did Circumcision Ruin Your Sex Life?" in the cover's
lower 
left corner) contains a landmark article, 
<a href="http://www.noharmm.org/separated.htm">"Separated At
Birth,"</a>
by Mark Jenkins, and six horrifying photographs by Bill Emory.

<P>Notice the baby's
splayed toes in the photograph on pages 130-131. Look at his 
<I>face</I>! 

<P>No, these photographs were not taken at a concentration
camp in Auschwitz. They were taken at a hospital in the United
States
of America. This is how most males born in the U.S. today are
welcomed
into the world: 
having their penises tortured, mutilated, crippled and disfigured
for
life.

<P>The compulsion of some victims of this tragedy to make 
their own mutilation seem normal, to universalize their 
mutilation by inflicting it on others, 
or to forestall their exposure as
instigators and perpetrators of sexual atrocities (and the
backlash of retaliation, reprisals, revenge and 
retribution that will inevitably follow), is so overwhelming that 
even in the face of lawsuits and scandal, they literally cannot stop 
themselves from mutilating others. 

<P>They often choose professions that provide them with a steady 
supply of unwitting victims. Some prefer adults. Some prefer 
children. Some prefer babies. (See <a href="fetish-c.htm">
"Recreational/Erotic/Fetish Circumcision"</a> and
<a href="little-b.htm">
"I'm going to cut your foreskin off, little boy."</a>)

<P>Parents who want to protect their children from these 
compulsive mutilators posing as healers or holy men 
should be warned to not let their normal, intact male child out of 
their sight even one moment with <I>any</I> medical doctor, nurse 
or other "health care provider" in the U.S. they are are not 
absolutely positive they can trust. 

<P>Parents should also be warned that the marketing of
foreskins stolen from human babies is a 
multi-million-dollar-a-year industry in the U.S. (See 
<a href="f4sale.htm">"Foreskins For Sale"</a> and 
<a href="fibro.htm">"Medical Journal Articles Documenting 
the Use of Human Foreskins in Medical, Pharmaceutical, and 
Other Commercial Enterprises."</a>) 

<P>The entire "medical" database in the U.S. about the foreskin and 
circumcision has been corrupted by superstition, myths, false 
information, cover-ups and lies. The chances of getting
accurate information about the foreskin and circumcision from a 
medical doctor in the U.S. are almost zero. Most are ignorant, 
in denial, afraid of "offending" someone, or silenced by their 
own humiliation. 

<P>The fact that one must go <I>outside</I> the medical profession 
to get accurate information about an amputation performed on the 
penises of more than 3,000 babies in this country every day by 
members <I>of</I> the medical profession, shows how very successful 
the perpetrators of this atrocity, in collusion with and abetted by
the media, have been in marketing and selling it to a trusting, 
unsuspecting public. 

<P>One day we will have laws to protect children from predators
who would take knives, clamps and electrocautery guns to their 
sex organs. Until then, parents have to protect their children as
best they can.  

<P>The fastest place to get the facts that make informed
parents say no to circumcisers is the Internet. (See
