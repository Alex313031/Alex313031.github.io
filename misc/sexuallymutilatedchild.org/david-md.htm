I was born in Mississippi in 1949. My father (and his five
brothers) was intact and saw no reason for routine infant
circumcision. Luckily for me my mother's obstetrician agreed, and
so I was left as God made me.      

<P>My brother was born a year later and he, too, was left intact. 
He and I were almost the only intact boys we knew. This didn't
bother my brother, but it did concern me. So at the age of 19 I
elected to be circumcised. But I soon realized what a great
mistake I had made!      

<P>Prior to circumcision the glans had been tender and moist,
similar in texture to the inner surface of the mouth. The inner
surface of the foreskin was smooth and tender as well, and very
sensitive to erotic stimulation. The frenulum, also, was delicate
and extremely sensitive to stimulation.      

<P>When I learned about masturbation from my (circumcised) peers, I
first attempted to masturbate as I imagined they did: keeping the
foreskin retracted with one hand, I tried rubbing the other hand
up and down over the glans. Ouch! This was much too painful to be
pleasurable at all. I soon learned the most common masturbation
technique of intact men: holding the penis on the shaft and
pulling the foreskin back and forth over the glans. (Later I
would find out that the same foreskin movement happens during 
intercourse, when the thrusting penis is gripped by the vagina.)

<P>On each downstroke the foreskin's delicate, moist inner surface
glided erotically over the glans, and the frenar band's gentle
constriction slipped down the glans and "snapped" past the highly
erogenous coronal ridge. When the foreskin was completely
retracted, the frenulum gently pulled down on the underside of
the glans (which I now know improves sensation to the glans
during intercourse).     

<P>On each upstroke the frenar band once again "snapped" past the
coronal ridge with an erotic mini-startle to the erogenous
system, and the foreskin's inner surface one again glided over
and stimulated the tender, moist glans as it moved up, which it
was designed to do.      

<P>In later years I learned that my circumcised friends sometimes or
always used artificial lubrication during masturbation. I never
needed any, as the glans and inner foreskin were naturally moist,
and the clear lubrication which was produced soon after having an
erection was automatically applied to the glans by foreskin
movement.      

<P>The glans was extremely sensitive to the touch, and only enjoyed
pleasure when it was stimulated by another mucous membrane (such
as the inner foreskin or an opening in another person's body). As
an inner organ (covered by the foreskin unless it was retracted)
the glans was much too tender to be rubbed casually.   

<P>Orgasms were reached easily (but not prematurely), and they were
intense enough to make my knees give way if I was standing.  
     
<P>Everything was different, however, after I was circumcised. 
Initially I experienced continuous and disturbing irritation, as
the glans was very tender before it became constantly exposed. It
took about a month for it to become accustomed to constant
friction from clothing, and sexual activity could be resumed. But
the sensations were dulled now.    

<P>The glans dried out and became much less sensitive. Even though I
still have a frenulum, its nerves have been damaged and it is
nowhere nearly as sensitive either.     

<P>I now had to masturbate most frequently with artificial
lubrication (or risk the distinct possibility of an irritated
penis). Orgasms were often achieved with extreme difficulty. They
were still pleasurable, but they were much, much less intense
than prior to circumcision.   

<P>I married at age 23, and throughout the next 17 years my wife and
I had a good sex life, but I often had trouble climaxing in
intercourse due to a lack of sensation with the glans. I never
could climax through fellatio, although this had not been a
problem when I was intact. I assumed that my orgasm problems were
probably psychological, and supposed that I would simply have to
adjust to it (my wife was a virgin when we married, so she
assumed that the long time I took to climax was normal, even if
it often caused her to become raw during intercourse).      

<P>In the late 1980s I came across references to foreskin
restoration, instructions for which I was able to obtain. I was
one of the rare and extremely fortunate men who were able to
achieve full glans coverage within a year of beginning skin
expansion techniques.    

<P>The glans is now tender and moist once again. It also has
regained most of its lost sensitivity, although not as much as
before circumcision. As a consequence of these changes I now have
no trouble climaxing during either intercourse or fellatio.  

<P>My wife enjoys the feeling of the loose, moving shaft skin during
intercourse, which gives her a different and "better" (according
to her) feeling vaginally. We both enjoy the "glide sensation" of
the loose-skinned penis during intercourse, and we like
intercourse more than before restoration.    

<P>I enjoy masturbating with my restored foreskin (which is almost
as good as the original, only lacking the frenar band), and my
wife also enjoys playing with my restored foreskin during
lovemaking and fellatio. She supports my views that routine
infant circumcision is genital mutilation that must be stopped.  

<P>Aesthetically, my penis appears quite natural and can pass as
intact in locker rooms to all but the most observant. I have even
passed as intact during medical examinations, for the
circumcision scar is not visible unless the foreskin is
retracted. (Knowledgeable physicians, however, may notice the
lack of the frenar band at the foreskin opening.)      

<P>My wife and I have two sons, born in 1979 and 1983. Although we
had to take a stand against the hospitals' wishes, we were able
to keep both of our sons intact.   

<P>Our sons already know why many of their friends are circumcised
(which my sons consider horrible), and as they become adults I
will share with them the sexual advantages of the intact penis.
Neither they, my father, my brother, or I ever had any problems
traditionally but mythologically associated with keeping the
penis intact.       

<P>I strongly believe, with millions of persons around the world,
that the penis was designed with a foreskin on purpose, and to
routinely redesign this organ at birth is a grave mistake and
probably a serious crime of child abuse.
