<P>
Dear Ms. Ellison,
<P>
I understand that charges of anti-semitism have been hurled at the
courageous nurses on your staff who refuse to participate in the barbaric
practice of circumcision.
<P>
The charges are preposterous. The American movement to outlaw
circumcision is teeming with Jews -- like myself. Our numbers in the
movement are way out of proportion to our percentage in the 
population overall. Many leaders of the anti-circumcision campaign 
are Jewish, as are medical doctors, researchers, college professors, and
others among the rank and file.
<P>
The Bible of our movement [<I>Circumcision: An American Health 
Fallacy</I>, Springer Publishing Co., 1980] -- an exhaustive, authoritative
volume compiling all the evidence for the case against circumcision -- 
was written by Edward Wallerstein, a Jew.
<P>
And it was Sigmund Freud himself who said that the root cause of
anti-semitism worldwide is circumcision. Freud was, of course, a Jew.
<P>
Please don't be swayed by the emotionally charged epithet of 
anti-semitism leveled against your noble nurses by a few hysterical 
individuals.
<P>
Respectfully,
<P>
Ralph Ginzburg
