<P>RE: British Medical Association Letter to the Editor Jan/Feb Men's Health

<P>Dear Mr. Lafavore and Mr. Wilks,

<P>If the British Medical Association finds medically unnecessary
circumcisions unethical, it must also find all non-medical circumcisions
unethical. Unethical acts with underlying religious and cultural
rationalizations remain unethical. Unnecessary amputations are always
damaging physical losses, with circumcisions additionally inflicting sexual
losses. Unnecessary amputations are an embarrassing failure of medical
therapeutics to maintain optimal health and physical integrity.

<P>The BMA medical ethicists refusing to comment on non-therapeutic
circumcisions, in fact, condone them. Where myths exist, 
deliberate
silence is a deception by intentional acts of omission. Silence deceives
people about the highly erogenous sexual functions of the foreskin. 
Families whose members lack a foreskin cannot know its sexual benefits. In
ignorance families make choices sexually damaging to themselves or their
children.

<P>Physical damage and loss is a medical issue mandating medical prevention. 
As we enter the new millenium, speak up, educate honestly, and treat sexual
parts of the body with respect. Maintain the genital and sexual integrity
of our children. Prevent circumcision.

<P>In disappointment,

<P>Eileen Marie Wayne, M.D.

The Jan/Feb issue of Men's Health has the following letter to the editor
from the Chairman of Medical Ethics Committee for the British Medical Association:

<ul>

Your July/August story on circumcision ("Separated at Birth")
misrepresented the views of the British Medical Association. Your story
quotes the BMA as having said that "to circumcise...would be unethical and
inappropriate." The words used in this quotation come from a section of our
published advice to doctors that reads, "Doctors have a duty to keep up to
date with developments in medical practice. Therefore, to circumcise for
therapeutic reasons where medical research has shown other techniques to be
at least as effective and less invasive would be unethical and
inappropriate." The quotation comes from a section that deals exclusively
with circumcision for <I>medical</I> purposes. The BMA neither
supports nor opposes non-therapeutic circumcision and does not comment on
whether religiously or culturally motivated circumcision is ethically
acceptable.
