Wondering if your baby should be circumcised?
<P>
Wondering if <i>any</i> baby should be circumcised?
<P>
Wondering if you should stop circumcising babies?
<P>
Wondering if you should stop even assisting with circumcising babies?
<P>
Wondering if circumcising babies should be outlawed?
<P>
Ask the question at the top of this page to a random assortment
of males who are <i>not</i> circumcised -- whose foreskins are intact -- 
and the only attitude possible for a person of good will to have
about the foreskin of a baby -- or anyone else -- should become
perfectly clear.
