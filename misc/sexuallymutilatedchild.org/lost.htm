<b>When a baby boy’s normal intact penis is circumcised, this is what is lost
-- <i>forever</i>:</b>
 
<P>*1. The <b>foreskin</b>, which comprises up to 50% (sometimes more) of the mobile
skin system of the penis.  If unfolded and spread out flat, the average
adult foreskin would measure about 15 square inches (the size of a 3 x
5-inch index card).  This highly specialized tissue normally covers the
glans and protects it from abrasion, drying, callusing (keratinization),
and contaminants of all kinds.  The effect of glans keratinization on human
sexuality has never been studied.

<P>*2. The <b>frenar band</b> of soft ridges -- the primary erogenous zone of the
male body.  Loss of this delicate belt of densely innervated, sexually
responsive tissue reduces the fullness and intensity of sexual response. 

<P>*3. The foreskin’s <b>"gliding action"</b> -- the hallmark mechanical feature of
the normal, natural, intact penis.  This non-abrasive gliding of the penis
in and out of itself within the vagina facilitates smooth, comfortable,
pleasurable intercourse for both partners. Without this gliding action, the
corona of the circumcised penis can function as a one-way valve, scraping
vaginal lubricants out into the drying air and making artificial lubricants
essential for comfortable intercourse.
          
<P>*4. Thousands of coiled fine-touch receptors called the <b>Meissner’s
corpuscles</b> -- the most important sensory component of the foreskin. Also
lost are branches of the <b>dorsal nerve</b> and between 10,000 and 20,000
<b>specialized erotogenic nerve endings</b> of several types, which can feel
slight motion and stretch, subtle changes in temperature, and fine
gradations in texture.

<P>*5. The <b>frenulum</b>, the highly erogenous V-shaped web-like tethering
structure on the underside of the glans; frequently amputated along with
the foreskin, or severed, either of which destroys its function and
potential for pleasure.

<P>6. Approximately half of the temperature-sensitive smooth muscle sheath
called the <b>dartos fascia</b>.

<P>7. The <b>immunological defense system of the soft mucosa</b>, which produces
plasma cells, which secrete immunoglobulin antibodies, and antibacterial
and antiviral proteins such as the pathogen-killing enzyme lysozyme.

<P>8. <b>Lymphatic vessels</b>, the loss of which reduces the lymph flow within that
part of the body’s immune system.

<P>9. <b>Estrogen receptors</b> -- the purpose of which is not yet fully understood
and needs further study.

<P>*10. The <b>apocrine glands</b> of the inner foreskin, which produce 
<b>pheromones</b> --
nature’s powerful, silent, invisible behavioral signals to potential sexual
partners. The effect of their absence on human sexuality has never been
studied.
 
<P>*11. <b>Sebaceous glands</b>, which lubricate and moisturize the foreskin and
glans, normally a protected internal organ -- like the tongue or vagina.

<P>12. Specialized epithelial <b>Langerhans cells</b>, a component of the immune
system in a whole penis.

<P>13. The pink to red to dark purple <b>natural coloration</b> of the glans.  The
connective tissue which protectively fuses the foreskin and glans together
while the penis develops is ripped apart during circumcision, wounding the
glans and the foreskin remnant, leaving them raw and subject to infection,
scarring, pitting, shrinkage, and eventual discoloration.

<P>*14. Some of the <b>penis length</b> and <b>penis circumference</b>
because its
double-layered wrapping of loose and usually overhanging foreskin is now
missing, making the circumcised penis truncated and thinner than a
full-sized intact penis.

<P>*15. Several feet of blood vessels, including the frenular artery and
branches of the dorsal artery.  The loss of this rich <b>vascularization</b>
interrupts normal blood flow to the shaft and glans of the penis, damaging
the natural function of the penis and altering its development.
 
<P>16. Every year boys lose their <b>entire penises</b> from circumcision accidents
and infections.  They are then "sexually reassigned" by castration and
"transgender surgery," and expected to live their lives as "females."

<P>17. Every year many boys lose <b>their lives</b> from the complications of
circumcision, a fact the profiteering billion-dollar-a-year circumcision
industry in the U.S. obscures and ignores.

<P>18. Delayed and diminished <b>bonding</b> with the mother and loss of 
innate sense of <b>trust</b> in human contact. 

<P>(*19. Although not yet proven scientifically, anecdotal evidence suggests 
that a penis without its foreskin lacks the capacity for the subtle 
<b>"cross communication"</b> that occurs only during contact between 
mucous membranes and that contributes to the experience of sexual pleasure.
In other words, <I>amputating a male's multi-functional foreskin is a 
neurological castration, which diminishes the intensity of the 
entire sexual experience for both the victimized male and his 
partner.</I>) 

<P>* Loss of each of these items reduces sexual pleasure, gratification, and
fulfillment.
