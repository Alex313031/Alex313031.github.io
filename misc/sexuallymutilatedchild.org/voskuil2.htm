<P>Susan Cordes-Green, Director
<br>Alliance for Sexual Abuse Prevention and Treatment
<br>P O Box 9858
<br>Fargo, ND 58106-9859

<P>Dear Ms Cordes-Green and Members of the ASAPT:

<P>After our all-too short conversation (8/ 21/98), I was pleased to find in
you someone informed and sympathetic to the issues surrounding genital
mutilation. However, I was left with the impression that one reason you and
the Alliance are not even more aggressive in addressing the sexual abuse of
non-medically indicated male prepuce amputations on nonconsenting
individuals is that no official body has declared it to be sexual child
abuse even though you and others feel it probably is (including Gladys
Cairns, Director of Child Protective Services and Chair of ASAPT, who said
as much to me in 1993). I ask you: Who is it that we expect to make such a
declaration?

<P>We certainly cannot be waiting for the perpetrators to do so. And the
victims are dismissed when they speak out. Ridicule, social and economic
ostracization meet them when they finally do become aware of the abuse.

<P>We can't expect the medical profession to make this declaration: They
include most of the perpetrators, or harbor the perpetrators; and many
physicians correctly see, anyway, that this is cosmetic surgery and not a
medical issue.

<P>What about the watchdog agencies of the medical community? Specifically the
North Dakota Board of Medical Examiners? This Board is charged with
controlling medical fraud and unnecessary surgery according to its mandate
in the ND Century Code. But here again, the Board is populated mainly by
physicians and even when one or two recognize the inappropriateness or the
amputation as did former Chair, Rhonda Ketterling, MD, the political
pressure within the closed medical community is too much to overcome, so
they fail to act. (See my letter, 3/3/95, to the Board, to which I've never
received a response, even after several addition requests, posted at:
<a href="voskuil1.htm">http://www.datasync.com/SexuallyMutilatedChild/</a>).

<P>Then there are the State Health Officers who over the years have said it is
a practice that should stop (Wentz); or begged off by saying the office was
concerned only with medical issues (an incorrect assessment or the office),
so elective prepuce amputation was not a medical issue (Rice); but they have
done nothing further towards informing the public or physicians out of fear
of inhibiting their career.

<P>Since this surgery is a social custom in the United States (at least for the
last couple of generations that have been birthed in hospitals), and a
surgery better described as "moral surgery" (e.g., to stop masturbation)
than as a medical procedure, and since it is an irreversible body
modification having to do with social customs and religio-philosophical
principles, perhaps we should be listening to what those say whose job it is
to fret out the historical reasons for the operation and the ethical
principles it follows or violates. One such, Margaret Somerville, medical
ethicist at McGill University, after many years of struggling with this
issue, has concluded it is "criminal assault" similar to female genital
mutilation, since the Canadian Pediatrics Society among others has declared
it a procedure with no medical benefit. I would put whatever prestige my
doctorate in philosophy and a lifetime of research and teaching has, towards
agreeing with this assessment.

<P>Then there are the world's medical societies. They may not come right out
and declare it to be sexual child abuse, but again they are not the moral or
legal guardians of society. However, no medical association in the world
considers amputation of healthy genital tissue to be a procedure done for
medical reasons.

<P>So while we wait for someone else to declare forced amputation of healthy
genital tissue to be sexual child abuse, the abuse continues because of
ignorance, malice, greed or fear. We are informed; we are those to whom
historical circumstances has cast this lot, like it or not; We must declare
to our corner of the world (that is so out of sync on this issue with most
of the rest of the world), that this amputation, for whatever reasons it
started and still continues, is no longer acceptable; It is morally
reprehensible and illegal even though enforcement agencies so far have
refused to prosecute, just as they refused to prosecute race discrimination
and other such civil rights issues for many decades.

<P>Permanently altering someone's body in such a significant way cannot be
dismissed (as Dr. Somerville says) as de minimis (legally insignificant). It
removes a valuable organ, that provides protection and stimulation. It
violates one's basic human and civil rights to decide for himself whether he
wants to live with a whole, intact body. Not only does it violate the laws
already on the books to protect those too helpless to protect themselves, it
also violates one's right to equal protection under the 14th Amendment of
the US Constitution since the passage of the ND and federal FGM laws. It
simply is a very unkind thing to do to another person; or as a Swedish nurse
exclaimed when she surprisingly learned what we do this to our sons: "It's
barbaric!" I got the same response when I was in China.

<P>So what better organization can there be to declare this act inappropriate
and abusive than the Alliance for Sexual Abuse PREVENTION and Treatment? The
members of ASAPT are people in many walks of life who know about abuse and
are charged with protecting the helpless. The time has come to stop waiting
for someone else to step forward. Time has come to take a stand and tell
parents that new information on the function of the foreskin and insights
into the rights of all individuals, even babies, requires us now to see that
the surgical amputation of this healthy genital tissue is sexual child
abuse. Further, those physicians who claim to be absolved from complicity in
the negative effects of this inappropriate surgery because they claim the
"patient" requested it, must be educated and/or legally restrained from
performing this amputation, first, because the parent is not the patient,
and second, because removal of healthy flesh without a compelling medical
reason violates the physician's own oath to First Do No Harm.

<P>I would hope that the Alliance would (1) see to it that the medical
community is appraised of the inappropriateness of the operation by helping
educate physicians on the important functions of the prepuce and its
anatomical development; * (2) get behind legislation to make third party
payments for these contraindicated amputations illegal, and (3) support
legislation to remove the sexism from the present law that only protects
female minors; (4) encourage the appropriate government and professional
agencies to disseminate information about the inappropriateness of
continuing to perform medically unnecessary penile reduction surgery; (5)
encourage educational institutions to talk about the issue in classes on
ethics, sociology, health, psychology, etc., and especially in the
appropriate classes in the University of North Dakota's School of Medicine's
departments of pediatrics, obstetrics, gynecology and urology; and finally,
(6) put together a taskforce of individuals responsible for recommending the
simultaneous end of the abuse statewide so no one agency or individual has
to go it alone thereby minimizing personal and economic hardships and the
need for litigation.

<P>Unless these measures are taken soon, the issue will become more and more
the province of litigation wherein the only winners will be lawyers. Sooner
or later the courts will have to see, as they finally did with other civil
rights issues, that however sanctioned and comfortable people are with
treating children like property, like a dog whose tail can be cropped at
will, that our society, which claims to be based on maximum individual
freedom, cannot allow someone the freedom to take away another's freedom to
decide for himself whether he wants his penis docked. This amputation
violates a person's freedom to have full sexual function and his freedom to
chose which religion he wants to identify with, since some religions do not
allow their adherents to worship with a mutilated body.

<P>I have spoken before, in 1993, to the Alliance on this issue, and would be
glad to do so again. I was excited to find the Alliance open to becoming
informed then, and encouraged now to find how much more informed you are
than people were five years ago. For those with internet access may I
suggest that many excellent sites exist such as 
<a href="http://www.cirp.org/CIRP/">http://www.cirp.org/CIRP/</a>.

<P>Here's hoping we can stop this way of introducing our trusting babies 
into the world--

<P>*Even the forced retraction of immature foreskins is abusive; the American
Academy of Pediatrics' pamphlet on the care of the intact male infant says:
"Foreskin retraction should never be forced. While the foreskin is still
attached to the glans of the penis, do not try to pull it back, especially
in an infant. Forcing the foreskin to retract before it is ready may harm
the penis and cause pain, bleeding, and tears in the skin."
