<blockquote>

The piece on your website entitled 
<a href="perfectc.htm">Infant Circumcision: The Perfect
Crime</a> is tremendously powerful. It is difficult to imagine
what emotions will erupt in a circumciser's brain when he reads
this. In all probability, he will have no emotional reaction at
all. Like most rapists, serial killers, and other criminally
deranged people, most serial circumcisers probably commit their
crimes in cold blood. The surge they get from committing these
atrocities is not emotional but chemical.

<P>The very act of shredding and mutilating a baby's penis with
knives, clamps, electrocautery guns, or fingernails affects the
serial circumciser's brain chemistry like a drug. The craving 
for this neurological stimulus is an addiction as real and as 
irresistible as an addiction to heroin. Carving, crushing,
burning, and slicing a baby's penis, reducing it to gore, getting
his hands covered with penis blood, and filling his ears with
shrieks and screams of agony and terror are the potent drug
cocktail 
the serial circumciser needs to make himself feel alive. 

<P>Criminologists and forensic scientists have long known that
there
is no treatment or cure for sado-sexual compulsions. Only 
death will bring peace to the criminally insane serial
circumciser. Jeffrey Dahmer found peace after a frightened fellow
prisoner smashed his head to a bloody pulp against a filthy
prison toilet. If this was the fate providence meted out to
a man who murdered young men and then fed off their corpses, what
fate awaits the monsters who torture, cripple, mutilate, maim,
butcher, dismember, vivisect, mine for profit, and even suck 
blood from the sex organs of <i>living</i> baby boys?

<P>At least Jeffrey Dahmer did not lie about what he was doing.
Unlike the serial circumciser, Dahmer did not sink to the
absurdity of calling his crimes "medical procedures." He
never tried to create "studies" to justify the killing and eating
of young men. The medicalization of psycho-sexual sadism and
barbaric blood rituals is a deception perfected by people like
Auschwitz Death Camp doctor Joseph "Angel of Death" Mengele 
and the American hospital ghoul: the serial circumciser.
