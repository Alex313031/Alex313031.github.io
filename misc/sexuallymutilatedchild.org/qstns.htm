<big><b>Questions for Circumcisers</b></big>

<P>Do you see any moral or ethical difference between circumcising
an adult by force and circumcising a baby, and if so, what is the
difference?

<P>How can you justify cutting off part of a baby's penis that so many
males who had that part of their penises cut off when they were babies
regret and resent that someone cut off  and that the vast majority of
males who have that part of their penises intact value -- even beyond
price -- and prefer -- infinitely prefer -- to keep intact?

<P>If there were anything about circumcision that would make you
think that babies should <I>not</I> be circumcised, would you want to
be aware of it -- and if you were aware of it, would you
acknowledge it?

<P>What fact(s) or consideration(s) -- if any -- would cause you to think
that babies should routinely be allowed to keep all of the penis they
are born with?
