<BR>Project Manager

<P>
Dear Ms. Walsh,
<P>
     I have just received a copy of the AAP
brochure, "Circumcision: Pros and Cons," and after
reading through its contents I cannot in good
conscience distribute it to my patients. The brochure is
strongly biased in favor of the procedure and laden
with factual errors. Because of these multiple
misrepresentations of the current medical literature, I
fear distribution of this brochure to my parents may
place me at increased risk for litigation. As a
fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, I am
also concerned that the brochure may place the
Academy at increased risk for successful litigation.
<P>
     To help in the effort to provide accurate
information to parents considering circumcision for
their sons, I have the following observations: 
<P>
     1) There is no mention in brochure what is
being removed by circumcision. Parents need to be
informed that the foreskin constitutes 30-50% of the
penile skin system and is, based on histologic studies,
the most highly innervated portion of the penis.1 They
need to know that the foreskin closely adheres to and
protects the mucosal surface of the glans from outside
irritation.
<P>
     2) The statement "Circumcision is one of the
oldest known surgical procedures in medicine" is
inaccurate. While it may be the oldest ritual procedure
of mankind, it was only rarely used as a medical
procedure until the last hundred years.
<P>
     3) The statement "During circumcision the
foreskin is removed so that the tip of the penis and
the opening through which the baby urinates are
exposed" is incomplete. It needs to be stated that
there is no medical reason for exposing the tip of the
penis. The penis functions perfectly well with the tip
unexposed. It also needs to be stated that exposure of
the tip can result in topical infections of the glans.
<P>
     4) Any mention of religious practices is
inappropriate. It gives the impression that the AAP is
proselytizing, which I am sure is not the intent of the
Academy.
<P>
     5) The statement, "After the circumcision,
the tip of the penis may seem raw," is inaccurate. By
stating that the penis may "seem" raw, the Academy
is minimizing the trauma wrought from this procedure.
Circumcision forcibly separates the mucosal surface of
the foreskin that adheres to the mucosal surface of
the glans. The tip of the penis is always raw after
circumcision. To illustrate this in terms parents will
understand, it may be best to equate it with having a
fingernail ripped off the nail bed.
<P>
     6) The section "Are there problems that can
happen after circumcision?" is woefully incomplete and
only addresses the more common, immediate
complications of circumcision. Very common problems
such as coronal adhesions (which occur in 25% of
circumcised boys), the glans being covered by skin
leading some parents to have the procedure redone
(17%), entrapped epithelial debris (16%), and topical
infections (7%) are not addressed.2 Parents need to be
informed that infant boys who have their foreskins do
not experience these problems.
<P>
     To be more balanced, death as a complication
to circumcision needs to be mentioned if cancer of the
penis is mentioned. Both of these entities happen with
approximately the same frequency.3
<P>
     The psychological effects, which have been
well documented, are not mentioned. It is important to
point out that circumcision has been shown to
adversely affect a newborns behavior for up to one
week after the procedure,4 that boys who were
circumcised at birth cry longer and louder when
receiving their immunizations,5 and that genital trauma
on children has been demonstrated leave a permanent
mark on the brain.6-7
<P>
     It also needs to be mentioned that the
adverse physical, sexual and psychological impact of
infant circumcision on adult males has not been
studied.
<P>
     7) The information given under the heading,
"Circumcision   pros and cons," is misleading and
reflects a pro-circumcision bias. It needs to be
mentioned that the circumcision rate in the United
States is falling and at the current trend circumcised
boys may soon be in the minority. Including the
statement that "Many parents choose to have their
sons circumcised because  all the other men in the
family were circumcised  or because they don't want
their son to feel  different, " grants legitimacy to these
vain considerations. As such, this statement
encourages cosmetic surgery on non-consenting
individuals. This is completely at odds with the
Academy's most recent position on informed consent
and violates most standards of medical ethics. Parents
also need to be informed that half of circumcised
infants will not look like the circumcised men in their
family for the first several years of life.8
<P>
     It is also prejudicial to suggest that parents
would need to justify their decision to leave their son's
foreskin in place while no suggestion is given that
parents tell their circumcised son why the end of their
penis is missing.
<P>
     8) The statement, "Circumcision lowers your
son's chances of getting a urinary tract infection (UTI)
in the first year of life," is inaccurate. At best the
retrospective studies that have been performed show a
possible association. It would be more accurate to
state that "Some studies have suggested that
circumcision may lower your son's chances of getting
a urinary tract infection (UTI) in the first year of life,
but further study in this area is needed. Fortunately,
UTIs are rare and easily treated with oral antibiotics."
<P>
     9) A discussion of penile cancer should not
be part of this brochure because it is so incredibly
rare. Also new studies have cast doubt over whether
circumcision plays a role in preventing penile cancer.9-10
If cancer is mentioned as a reason for circumcising,
then death needs to be mentioned as a complication.
<P>
     10) The statement, "Research shows that
males who are circumcised have a slightly lower risk
of getting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)," is
completely untrue. Several new studies have shown
that circumcised males are at higher risk for
developing genital warts,11-12 gonorrhea, syphilis,13
non-gonococcal urethritis,14-15 and HIV infections.16-18
<P>
     11) The statement, "Circumcision eliminates
foreskin infections that occur at the peak age of 3-5
years," is completely untrue and has never been
documented in the medical literature. In an ongoing
prospective study, which I am conducting, the opposite
has been found.19 In addition, a retrospective study
found more penile problems in circumcised boys at
these younger ages than those left intact.20
<P>
     12) The statement, "Circumcision prevents
phimosis, a narrow opening that makes it impossible to
retract the foreskin at a later age," is pure
unsubstantiated speculation and has never been
documented in the medical literature. From the
accurate incidences published in the medical literature
the percentage of intact boys developing "true"
phimosis and those boys who are circumcised who
develop phimosis are nearly identical.21-24
<P>
     13) The statement, "Genital hygiene, which is
particularly important in unsanitary conditions, may be
easier after circumcision," is likewise pure speculation.
My ongoing prospective study has shown the exact
opposite to be the case. The reason for this is simple.
The foreskin has smooth muscle near the tip that
puckers it shut, thus preventing stool and feces from
entering. The circumcised boy does not have such
protection.
<P>
     14) The statement, "Circumcision may be
risky if done later in life," is inaccurate. The
complication rates reported in the medical literature for
neonatal and post-neonatal circumcision indicate the
complication rate for neonatal circumcision may be
higher.25-32
<P>
     15) The statement, "parents should try to
make a decision about circumcision," assumes that
parent can ethically implement their decision about
circumcision. This is contrary to most international
statements on human rights and United States legal
precedents.33 It is also contrary the AAP's position on
informed consent.34 To date the AAP has not
adequately addressed this issue and urgently needs to
do so. To assume that parents have the right to make
this decision when legally and ethically they may not,
is a bias in favor of parental rights over a child's
rights, which is out of character for the AAP and
encourages unnecessary surgery.
<P>
     16) The statement, "Infants who are
circumcised without pain medication will feel some
pain," is incredibly misleading. All of these infants
experience excruciating pain. New evidence suggests
that similar interventions on newborns are more painful
for them than older infants and children.35 Sucking on
a sugar solution has been shown to decrease the
crying associated with circumcision36 but the humoral
changes associated with the stress of the procedure
are not ameliorated.37 Minimizing the pain related
aspects of the procedure again reflects the
pro-circumcision bias of this brochure. Parents should
be encouraged to seek out a physician who uses
anesthesia. 
<P>
     17) The statement, "The Academy is
absolutely opposed to this practice [female genital
mutilation] in all forms as it is disfiguring and has no
medical benefit," is hypocritical because the same
language applies to male circumcision.
<P>
     18) The statement, "boys should be taught
the importance of washing underneath the foreskin
everyday to remove the smegma   a white cheese-like
substance that is found under the foreskin," is
unbalanced. In my ongoing prospective study 17% of
circumcised infants had a "white cheese-like
substance" between their glans and remnant foreskin
while none of the intact boys did.38 The statement
incorrectly implies that only intact boys can develop
can develop a "white cheese-like" substance.
<P>
     19) The brochure closes by saying,
"Circumcisions are often done for religious, social, and
cultural reasons. The Academy suggests parents talk
to their pediatrician about circumcision and make a
decision after looking at the facts." This encourages
parents to seek advice from physicians in areas in
which they have no expertise. As a pediatrician I feel
comfortable discussing the medical aspects of
circumcision, but I am sure I will dispense inaccurate
information concerning the social, religious, and
cultural aspects of this ritual.
<P>
     While the Academy had the best of intentions
in producing "Circumcision Pros and Cons: Guidelines
for Parents," the results are unfortunate. The obvious
pro-circumcision bias of the brochure only propagates
the disrespect the Academy earned when it released
the equally biased, inaccurate Task Force report in
1989. Pediatricians and parents look to the Academy
for accurate unbiased information, this brochure falls
far short of this expectation. 
<P>
     What is more important, the brochure places
both the pediatrician and the Academy at risk for
litigation. The untruths, inaccuracies, and misleading
statements noted above make it appear as though the
Academy was purposely covering up the truth to let
infant circumcision continue at the present rate. This
procedure nets physicians and hospitals on the order
of $200 million per year. Do the interests of the
Academy rest with the what is best for the infant boy
or the physician's bottom line? The content of this
brochure makes a strong case that the rights of infant
boys have been sold out for cold cash. I do not think
this was the Academy's intent, but it is obviously the
result. Knowingly publishing inaccurate information can
only get the Academy in trouble.
<P>
     For the most part I am proud to be a fellow
of the AAP, especially when Academy has acted as
the champion of children's rights, but this brochure is
an embarrassment.
<P>
     I implore you to revise this brochure, and this
time try telling the truth in a balanced fashion.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
