<P>Dear Obstetric & Gynecologic Circumcisers:

<P><b>Focus on Erogenous Foreskin Rather Than Lucrative Surgery</b>
<br>It is no surprise that you, as surgeons, are interested in circumcision 
surgery.  It is surprising that you, as human beings, are not interested in 
the gliding, lubricating, and erogenous sexual benefits of the foreskin.  Dr. John Taylor beautifully describes the anatomy and sex nerves of the foreskin in the February 1996 British Journal of Urology.

<P><b>Gynecologists Doing Male Sex Surgery?</b>
<br>The male penis is outside your area of competence, gynecology. You 
fail to teach your residents the sexual benefits of the foreskin, the human 
right of the patient and his partner to learn about and enjoy the erogenous 
pleasure of his complete penis, the ethics of unnecessary surgery on 
non-consenting patients, and the dysparunia caused by the circumcised 
ramrod compared to the natural, frictionless, well-lubricated, highly 
erogenous intact penis.

<P><b>Penis: Like a Pacifier in a Latex Finger?</b>
<br>The pacifier-in-a-latex-finger surgical model denigrates the human 
foreskin.  
The foreskin is more like a double-everting gliding sleeve on a fallopiscope, 
gliding between the vagina and the glans during intercourse. Most 
important, 
the double-everting foreskin is richly endowed with highly erogenous sex 
nerves. Propagating circumcision to four gynecology residents at a time 
using a pacifier-in-a-latex-finger model is the assembly line production of 
serial circumcisers for assembly line circumcisions.

<P><b>Circumcision as a Cause of Dysparunia</b>
<br>The role of the circumcised penis in causing dysparunia in your female 
patients is a more appropriate subject for the gynecologist. Please refer to 
the Jan. 1999 Supplement to the British Journal of Urology. The entire 
January BJU is about the harm of circumcision. It updates the 500-year 
misinterpretation of 
the prepuce of as "a little piece of skin." Articles deal with the extreme 
pain perpetrated upon tethered protesting infants, adult men's 
dissatisfaction with circumcision, its damaging effect on women's enjoyment 
of sexual intercourse, human rights issues, and rejoinders to opponents of 
circumcision.

<P><b>By HCFA Criteria Circumcision is Fraud & Abuse</b> 
<br>The Health Care Financing Administration is crystal clear about 
necessity 
criteria. According to HCFA, circumcision requires a patient-voiced 
complaint, physical abnormality, and a pathologist's report documenting the 
pathology. Failing HCFA necessity criteria, circumcision is fraud and abuse.

<P><b>Severity of Illness Intensity of Service</b>
<br>The standard of for hygiene is bathing, not amputation.
The standard of care for infections is antibiotics, not amputation. Circumcision 
fails the Severity of Illness Intensity of Service criteria. The foreskin is 
not a germ factory. Van Howe clearly elucidates the immunologic functions of 
the foreskin. Additionally, the neonatal foreskin is firmly adherent to the 
glans like a fingernail to its nail bed. It protects both mechanically and 
immunologically against infection.

<P><b>No Debate</b>
<br>For scientific evidence, compare statistics with non-circumcising countries.  
Intact neonates, with a virgin foreskin never subjected to ripping 
retraction from the glans during their medical exams, fare better than 
either circumcised infants or uncircumcised infants subjected to ripping 
retraction. Parents need to know that the infant is born with the foreskin 
fused to the glans and must view ripping of the immature foreskin from the 
immature glans as a painful type of sexual abuse, an invitation to infection, and damage to the undeveloped erogenous sex nerves.

<P><b>Foreskin Pleasure Not Pain</b>
<br>Ethics mandate that the child keep his foreskin and learn its gliding, 
lubricating, and erogenous sexual benefits. The child is the owner of his 
foreskin. The child is the patient. Circumcision a not a matter of family 
choice. The circumciser needs the signed legal informed consent of the 
patient himself. Once he has enjoyed his god-given foreskin, he will not 
consent to man taking it by circumcision.

<P>Sincerely,

<P>Eileen Marie Wayne, M.D.
