        Western countries have no tradition of circumcision. In
antiquity, the expansion of the Greek and Roman Empires brought
Westerners into contact with the peoples of the Middle East, some of
whom marked their children with circumcision and other sexual
mutilations.  To protect these children, the Greeks and Romans passed
laws forbidding circumcision.[1]  Over the centuries, the Catholic
Church has passed many similar laws.[2,3]  The traditional Western
response to circumcision has been revulsion and indignation.
<P>
        Circumcision started in America during the masturbation
hysteria of the Victorian Era, when a few American doctors circumcised
boys to punish them for masturbating.  Victorian doctors knew very
well that circumcision denudes, desensitizes, and disables the penis.
Nevertheless, they were soon claiming that circumcision cured
epilepsy, convulsions, paralysis, elephantiasis, tuberculosis, eczema,
bed-wetting, hip-joint disease, fecal incontinence, rectal prolapse,
wet dreams, hernia, headaches, nervousness, hysteria, poor eyesight,
idiocy, mental retardation, and insanity.[4]
<P>
        In fact, no procedure in the history of medicine has been
claimed to cure and prevent more diseases than circumcision.  As late
as the 1970s, leading American medical textbooks still advocated
routine circumcision as a way to prevent masturbation.[5]  The
antisexual motivations behind an operation that entails cutting off
part of the penis are obvious.
<P>
        The radical practice of routinely circumcising babies did not
begin until the Cold War era.  This institutionalization of what
amounted to compulsory circumcision was part of the same movement that
pathologized and medicalized birth and actively discouraged
breastfeeding.  Private-sector, corporate-run hospitals
institutionalized routine circumcision without ever consulting the
American people.  There was no public debate or referendum.  It was
only in the 1970s that a series of lawsuits forced hospitals to obtain
parental consent to perform this contraindicated but highly profitable
surgery.  Circumcisers responded by inventing new "medical" reasons
for circumcision in an attempt to scare parents into consenting.
<P>
        Today the reasons given for circumcision have been updated to
play on contemporary fears and anxieties; but one day they, too, will
be considered irrational. Now that such current excuses as the claim
that this procedure prevents cancer and sexually transmitted diseases
have been thoroughly discredited, circumcisers will undoubtedly invent
new ones.  But if circumcisers were really motivated by purely medical
considerations, the procedure would have died out long ago, along with
leeching, skull-drilling, and castration.  The fact that it has not
suggests that the compulsion to circumcise came first, the "reasons,"
later.
<P>
        Millions of years of evolution have fashioned the human body
into a model of refinement, elegance, and efficiency, with every part
having a function and purpose.  Evolution has determined that mammals'
genitals should be sheathed in a protective, responsive, multipurpose
foreskin.  Every normal human being is born with a foreskin.  In
females, it protects the glans of the clitoris; in males, it protects
the glans of the penis.  Thus, the foreskin is an essential part of
human sexual anatomy.
<P>
        Parents should enjoy the arrival of a new child with as few
worries as possible.  The birth of a son in the US, however, is often
fraught with anxiety and confusion.  Most parents are pressured to
hand their baby sons over to a stranger, who, behind closed doors,
straps babies down and cuts their foreskins off.  The 
billion-dollar-a-year circumcision industry has bombarded Americans with
confusing rhetoric and calculated scare tactics.
<P>
        Information about the foreskin itself is almost always missing
from discussions about circumcision.  The mass circumcision campaigns
of the past few decades have resulted in pandemic ignorance about this
remarkable structure and its versatile role in human sexuality.
Ignorance and false information about the foreskin are the rule in
American medical literature, education, and practice.  Most American
medical textbooks depict the human penis, without explanation, as
circumcised, as if it were so by nature.
<P>
<br>
<center><h3>What Is the Foreskin?</h3></center>
<P>
        The foreskin is a uniquely specialized, sensitive, functional
organ of touch. No other part of the body serves the same purpose. As
a modified extension of the penile shaft skin, the foreskin covers and
usually extends beyond the glans before folding under itself and
finding its circumferential point of attachment just behind the corona
(the rim of the glans). The foreskin is, therefore, a double-layered
organ.  Its true length is twice the length of its external fold,
comprising 80 percent or more of the penile skin covering,[6] or at
least 25 percent of the flaccid penis's length.
<P>
         The foreskin contains a rich concentration of blood vessels 
and nerve endings.  It is lined
with the peripenic muscle sheet, a smooth muscle layer with
longitudinal fibers. These muscle fibers are whorled, forming a kind
of sphincter that ensures optimum protection of the urinary tract from
contaminants of all kinds.
<P>
        Like the undersurface of the eyelids or the inside of the
cheek, the undersurface of the foreskin consists of mucous membrane.
It is divided into two distinct zones: the soft mucosa and the ridged
mucosa.  The soft mucosa lies against the glans penis and contains
ectopic sebaceous glands that secrete emollients, lubricants, and
protective antibodies.  Similar glands are found in the eyelids and
mouth.
<P>
        Adjacent to the soft mucosa and just behind the lips of the
foreskin is the ridged mucosa. This exquisitely sensitive structure
consists of tightly pleated concentric bands, like the elastic bands
at the top of a sock. These expandable pleats allow the foreskin lips
to open and roll back, exposing the glans.  The ridged mucosa gives
the foreskin its characteristic taper.
<P>
        On the underside of the glans, the foreskin's point of
attachment is advanced toward the meatus (urethral opening) and forms
a bandlike ligament called the frenulum.  It is identical to the
frenulum that secures the tongue to the floor of the mouth. The
foreskin's frenulum holds it in place over the glans, and, in
conjunction with the smooth muscle fibers, helps return the retracted
foreskin to its usual forward position over the glans.
<P>
<br>
<center><h3>Retraction of the Foreskin</h3></center>
<P>
        At birth, the foreskin is usually attached to the glans, very
much as a fingernail is attached to a finger. By puberty, the penis
will usually have completed its development, and the foreskin will
have separated from the glans.[8]  This separation occurs in its own
time; there is no set age by which the foreskin and glans must be
separated.  One wise doctor described the process thus, "The foreskin
therefore can be likened to a rosebud which remains closed and
muzzled. Like a rosebud, it will only blossom when the time is right.
No one opens a rosebud to make it blossom."[9]
<P>
        Even if the glans and foreskin separate naturally in infancy,
the foreskin lips can normally dilate only enough to allow the passage
of urine.  This ideal feature protects the glans from premature
exposure to the external environment.
<P>
        The penis develops naturally throughout childhood. Eventually,
the child will, on his own, make the wondrous discovery that his
foreskin will retract.  There is no reason for parents, physicians, or
other caregivers to manipulate a child's penis.  The only person to
retract a child's foreskin should be the child himself, when he has
discovered that his foreskin is ready to retract.
<P>
        Parents should be wary of anyone who tries to retract their
child's foreskin, and especially wary of anyone who wants to cut it
off.  Human foreskins are in great demand for any number of commercial
enterprises, and the marketing of purloined baby foreskins is a
multimillion-dollar-a-year industry.  Pharmaceutical and cosmetic
companies use human foreskins as research material.  Corporations such
as Advanced Tissue Sciences, Organogenesis, and BioSurface Technology
use human foreskins as the raw materials for a type of breathable
bandage.
<P>
<br>
<center><h3>What Are the Foreskin's Functions?</h3></center>
<P>
        The foreskin has numerous protective, sensory, and sexual
functions.
<P>
        <b>* Protection</b>: Just as the eyelids protect the eyes, the
foreskin protects the glans and keeps its surface soft, moist, and
sensitive. It also maintains optimal warmth, pH balance, and
cleanliness.  The glans itself contains no sebaceous glands--glands
that produce the sebum, or oil, that moisturizes our skin.[11]  The
foreskin produces the sebum that maintains proper health of the
surface of the glans.
<P>
        <b>* Immunological Defense</b>: The mucous membranes that line all
body orifices are the body's first line of immunological defense.
Glands in the foreskin produce antibacterial and antiviral proteins
such as lysozyme.[12]  Lysozyme is also found in tears and mother's
milk.  Specialized epithelial Langerhans cells, an immune system
component, abound in the foreskin's outer surface.  Plasma cells in
the foreskin's mucosal lining secrete immunoglobulins, antibodies that
defend against infections.
<P>
        <b>* Erogenous Sensitivity</b>: The foreskin is as sensitive as the
fingertips or the lips of the mouth. It contains a richer variety and
greater concentration of specialized nerve receptors than any other
part of the penis.[15] These specialized nerve endings can discern
motion, subtle changes in temperature, and fine gradations of
texture.[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]
<P>
        <b>* Coverage during Erection</b>: As it becomes erect, the penile
shaft becomes thicker and longer.  The double-layered foreskin
provides the skin necessary to accommodate the expanded organ and to
allow the penile skin to glide freely, smoothly, and pleasurably over
the shaft and glans.
<P>
        <b>* Self-Stimulating Sexual Functions</b>: The foreskin's
double-layered sheath enables the penile shaft skin to glide back and
forth over the penile shaft. The foreskin can normally be slipped all
the way, or almost all the way, back to the base of the penis, and
also slipped forward beyond the glans.  This wide range of motion is
the mechanism by which the penis and the orgasmic triggers in the
foreskin, frenulum, and glans are stimulated.
<P>
        <b>* Sexual Functions in Intercourse</b>: One of the foreskin's
functions is to facilitate smooth, gentle movement between the mucosal
surfaces of the two partners during intercourse.  The foreskin enables
the penis to slip in and out of the vagina nonabrasively inside its
own slick sheath of self-lubricating, movable skin.  The female is
thus stimulated by moving pressure rather than by friction only, as
when the male's foreskin is missing.
<P>
        The foreskin fosters intimacy between the two partners by
enveloping the glans and maintaining it as an internal organ. The
sexual experience is enhanced when the foreskin slips back to allow
the male's internal organ, the glans, to meet the female's internal
organ, the cervix--a moment of supreme intimacy and beauty.
<P>
        The foreskin may have functions not yet recognized or
understood.  Scientists in Europe recently detected estrogen receptors
in its basal epidermal cells.[24]  Researchers at the University of
Manchester found that the human foreskin has apocrine glands.[25]
These specialized glands produce pheromones, nature's chemical
messengers.  Further studies are needed to fully understand these
features of the foreskin and the role they play.
<P>
<br>
<center><h3>Care of the Foreskin</h3></center>
<P>
        The natural penis requires no special care.  A child's
foreskin, like his eyelids, is self-cleansing.  For the same reason it
is inadvisable to lift the eyelids and wash the eyeballs, it is
inadvisable to retract a child's foreskin and wash the glans.
Immersion in plain water during the bath is all that is needed to keep
the intact penis clean.[26]
<P>
        The white emollient under the child's foreskin is called
smegma.  Smegma is probably the most misunderstood, most unjustifiably
maligned substance in nature. Smegma is clean, not dirty, and is
beneficial and necessary.  It moisturizes the glans and keeps it
smooth, soft, and supple.  Its antibacterial and antiviral properties
keep the penis clean and healthy.  All mammals produce smegma.  Thomas
J. Ritter, MD, underscored its importance when he commented, "The
animal kingdom would probably cease to exist without smegma."[27]
<P>
        Studies suggest that it is best not to use soap on the glans
or foreskin's inner fold.[23]  Forcibly retracting and washing a
baby's foreskin destroys the beneficial bacterial flora that protect
the penis from harmful germs and can lead to irritation and infection.
The best way to care for a child's intact penis is to leave it alone.
After puberty, males can gently rinse their glans and foreskin with
warm water, according to their own self-determined needs.
<P>
<br>
<center><h3>How Common Is Circumcision?</h3></center>
<P>
        Circumcision is almost unheard of in Europe, South America,
and non-Muslim Asia. In fact, only 10 to 15 percent of men throughout
the world are circumcised.  The vast majority of whom are Muslim.[29]
The neonatal circumcision rate in the western US has now fallen to
34.2 percent.[30]  This relatively diminished rate may surprise
American men born during the era when nearly 90 percent of baby boys
were circumcised automatically, with or without their parents'
consent.
<P>
<br>
<center><h3>How Does Circumcision Harm?</h3></center>
<P>
        The "medical" debate about the "potential health benefits" of
circumcision rarely addresses its real effects.
<p>
        <b>* Circumcision denudes</b>: Depending on the amount of skin cut
off, circumcision robs a male of as much as 80 percent or more of his
penile skin. Depending on the foreskin's length, cutting it off makes
the penis as much as 25 percent or more shorter. Careful anatomical
investigations have shown that circumcision cuts off more than 3 feet
of veins, arteries, and capillaries, 240 feet of nerves, and more than
20,000 nerve endings.[31]The foreskin's muscles, glands, mucous
membrane, and epithelial tissue are destroyed, as well.
<P>
        <b>* Circumcision desensitizes</b>: Circumcision desensitizes the
penis radically.  Foreskin amputation means severing the rich nerve
network and all the nerve receptors in the foreskin itself.
Circumcision almost always damages or destroys the frenulum. The loss
of the protective foreskin desensitizes the glans.  Because the
membrane covering the permanently externalized glans is now subjected
to constant abrasion and irritation, it keratinizes, becoming dry and
tough.  The nerve endings in the glans, which in the intact penis are
just beneath the surface of the mucous membrane, are now buried by
successive layers of keratinization.  The denuded glans takes on a
dull, grayish, sclerotic appearance.
<P>
        <b>* Circumcision disables</b>: The amputation of so much penile skin
permanently immobilizes whatever skin remains, preventing it from
gliding freely over the shaft and glans.  This loss of mobility
destroys the mechanism by which the glans is normally stimulated.
When the circumcised penis becomes erect, the immobilized remaining
skin is stretched, sometimes so tightly that not enough skin is left
to cover the erect shaft.  Hair-bearing skin from the groin and
scrotum is often pulled onto the shaft, where hair is not normally
found.  The surgically externalized mucous membrane of the glans has
no sebaceous glands.  Without the protection and emollients of the
foreskin, it dries out, making it susceptible to cracking and
bleeding.
<P>
        <b>* Circumcision disfigures</b>: Circumcision alters the appearance
of the penis drastically.  It permanently externalizes the glans,
normally an internal organ.  Circumcision leaves a large circumferential 
surgical scar on the penile shaft.  Because circumcision
usually necessitates tearing the foreskin from the glans, pieces of
the glans may be torn off, too, leaving it pitted and scarred.  Shreds
of foreskin may adhere to the raw glans, forming tags and bridges of
dangling, displaced skin.[32]
<P>
        Depending on the amount of skin cut off and how the scar
forms, the circumcised penis may be permanently twisted, or curve or
bow during erection.[33]  The contraction of the scar tissue may pull
the shaft into the abdomen, in effect shortening the penis or burying
it completely.[34]
<P>
        <b>* Circumcision disrupts circulation</b>: Circumcision interrupts
the normal circulation of blood throughout the penile skin system and
glans. The blood flowing into major penile arteries is obstructed by
the line of scar tissue at the point of incision, creating backflow
instead of feeding the branches and capillary networks beyond the
scar.  Deprived of blood, the meatus may contract and scarify,
obstructing the flow of urine.[35]  This condition, known as meatal
stenosis, often requires corrective surgery.  Meatal stenosis is found
almost exclusively among boys who have been circumcised.
<P>
        Circumcision also severs the lymph vessels, interrupting the
circulation of lymph and sometimes causing lymphedema, a painful,
disfiguring condition in which the remaining skin of the penis swells
with trapped lymph fluid.
<P>
        <b>* Circumcision harms the developing brain</b>: Recent studies
published in leading medical journals have reported that circumcision
has longlasting detrimental effects on the developing brain,[36]
adversely altering the brain's perception centers.  Circumcised boys
have a lower pain threshold than girls or intact boys.[37]
Developmental neuropsychologist Dr. James Prescott suggests that
circumcision can cause deeper and more disturbing levels of
neurological damage, as well. [38, 39]
<P>
        <b>* Circumcision is unhygienic and unhealthy</b>: One of the most
common myths about circumcision is that it makes the penis cleaner and
easier to take care of.  This is not true.  Eyes without eyelids would
not be cleaner; neither would a penis without its foreskin.  The
artificially externalized glans and meatus of the circumcised penis
are constantly exposed to abrasion and dirt, making the circumcised
penis, in fact, more unclean.  The loss of the protective foreskin
leaves the urinary tract vulnerable to invasion by bacterial and viral
pathogens.
<P>
        The circumcision wound is larger than most people imagine. It
is not just the circular point of union between the outer and inner
layers of the remaining skin.  Before a baby is circumcised, his
foreskin must be torn from his glans, literally skinning it alive.
This creates a large open area of raw, bleeding flesh, covered at best
with a layer of undeveloped protomucosa.  Germs can easily enter the
damaged tissue and bloodstream through the raw glans and, even more
easily, through the incision itself.
<P>
        Even after the wound has healed, the externalized glans and
meatus are still forced into constant unnatural contact with urine,
feces, chemically treated diapers, and other contaminants.
<P>
        Female partners of circumcised men do not report a lower rate
of cervical cancer,[40] nor does circumcision prevent penile
cancer.[41]  A recent study shows that the penile cancer rate is
higher in the US than in Denmark, where circumcision, except among
Middle Eastern immigrant workers, is almost unheard of.[42]  Indeed,
researchers should investigate the possibility that circumcision has
actually increased the rate of these diseases.
<P>
        Circumcision does not prevent acquisition or transmission of
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  In fact, the US has both the
highest percentage of sexually active circumcised males in the Western
world and the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases,
including AIDS.  Rigorously controlled prospective studies show that
circumcised American men are at a greater risk for bacterial and viral
STDs, especially gonorrhea,[43] nongonoccal urethritis,[44] human
papilloma virus,[45] herpes simplex virus type 2,[46] and
chlamydia.[47]
<P>
        <b>* Circumcision is always risky</b>: Circumcision always carries
the risk of serious, even tragic, consequences.  Its surgical
complication rate is one in 500.[48]  These complications include
uncontrollable bleeding and fatal infections.[49] There are many
published case reports of gangrene following circumcision.[50]
Pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus, proteus, pseudomonas,
other coliforms, and even tuberculosis can cause infections leading to
death.[51, 52]  These organisms enter the wound because it provides
easy entry, not because the child is predisposed to infection.
<P>
        Medical journals have published numerous accounts of babies
who have had part or all of their glans cut off while they were being
circumcised.[53 54 55]  Other fully conscious, unanesthetized babies
have had their entire penis burned off with an electrocautery 
gun.[56,57,58]  The September 1989 <i>Journal of Urology</i> published an 
account of
four such cases.[59] The article described the sex-change operation as
"feminizing genitoplasty," performed on these babies in an attempt to
change them into girls.  The March 1997 <i>Archives of Pediatrics and
Adolescent Medicine</i> described one young person's horror on learning
that "she" had been born a normal male, but that a circumciser had
burned his penis off when he was a baby.[60]  Many other similar cases
have been documented[61,62]  Infant circumcision has a reported death
rate of one in 500,000.[63,64]
<P>
        <b>* Circumcision harms mothers</b>: Scientific studies have
consistently shown that circumcision disrupts a child's behavioral
development.  Studies performed at the University of Colorado School
of Medicine showed that circumcision is followed by prolonged,
unrestful non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep.[65]  In response to the
lengthy bombardment of their neural pathways with unbearable pain, the
circumcised babies withdrew into a kind of semicoma that lasted days
or even weeks.
<P>
        Numerous other studies have proven that circumcision disrupts
the mother-infant bond during the crucial period after birth. Research
has also shown that circumcision disrupts feeding patterns.  In a
study at the Washington University School of Medicine, most babies
would not nurse right after they were circumcised, and those who did
would not look into their mothers' eyes.[66]
<P>
        <b>* Circumcision violates patients' and human rights</b>: No 
one has the right to cut off any part of someone else's genitals without 
that
person's competent, fully informed consent.  Since it is the infant
who must bear the consequences, circumcision violates his legal rights
both to refuse treatment and to seek alternative treatment. In 1995,
the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics stated that
only a competent patient can give patient consent or informed
consent.[67]  An infant is obviously too young to consent to anything.
He must be protected from anyone who would take advantage of his
defenselessness.  The concept of informed parental permission allows
for medical interventions in situations of clear and immediate medical
necessity only, such as disease, trauma, or deformity.  The human
penis in its normal, uncircumcised state satisfies none of these
requirements.
<P>
        Physicians have a duty to refuse to perform circumcision. They
also must educate parents who, out of ignorance or misguidance,
request this surgery for their sons.  The healthcare professional's
obligation is to protect the interests of the child.  It is unethical
in the extreme to force upon a child an amputation he almost certainly
would never have chosen for himself.
<P>
<br>
<center><h3>Common Sense</h3></center>
<P>
        To be intact, as nature intended, is best. The vast majority
of males who are given the choice value their wholeness and keep their
foreskins, for the same reason they keep their other organs of
perception.  Parents in Europe and non-Muslim Asia never have forced
their boys to be circumcised.  It would no more occur to them to cut
off part of their boys' penises than it would to cut off part of their
ears.  Respecting a child's right to keep his genitals intact is
normal and natural.  It is conservative in the best sense of the word.
<P>
        A circumcised father who has mixed feelings about his intact
newborn son may require gentle, compassionate psychological counseling
to help him come to terms with his loss and to overcome his anxieties
about normal male genitalia.  In such cases, the mother should
steadfastly protect her child, inviting her husband to share this
protective role and helping him diffuse his negative feelings.  Most
parents want what is best for their baby. Wise parents listen to their
hearts and trust their instinct to protect their baby from harm.  The
experience of the ages has shown that babies thrive best in a trusting
atmosphere of love, gentleness, respect, acceptance, nurturing, and
intimacy.  Cutting off a baby's foreskin shatters this trust.
<P>
        Circumcision wounds and harms the baby and the person the baby
will become. Parents who respect their son's wholeness are bequeathing
to him his birthright--his body, perfect and beautiful in its
entirety.
