A West Virginia physician asserts that circumcision, in 
<br>addition to crippling and killing many infants, may cause
<br>reduced sexual pleasure, homosexuality, and antisemitism</b></center>
<P>
<BR>
      On July 20, 1964, the Medical Tribune published a letter
from a Baltimore physician who called for the compulsory
circumcision of all men seeking to get married. Indeed, he
went on to demand Federal legislation requiring the
circumcision of <I>every</I> male infant within the first 8 days of
life.
<P>
      Now, just why anyone would want circumcision made
compulsory may seem puzzling. After all, circumcision is
already a routine operation in this country. What need for
legislation when 98% of all newborn boys, before leaving
hospitals, are circumcised? When Sexology Magazine can
maintain that circumcision has become a "status symbol," and
when a physician can lament that "one has to lop it off along
with the Joneses"? When just about everyone, including physicians
who should know better, has bought the myth that circumcision in
some mysterious way prevents certain forms of cancer?
<P>
      One answer, of course, is that if circumcision were made
compulsory, the circumciser would be protected whenever he
happens to cripple or kill the little boy he operates on --
"complication" that is not so very uncommon. Another answer, I
think, must be sought in the darker regions of the human mind,
because circumcision is simply an unmitigated fraud. It is
nothing but wanton and unnecessary mutilation. The annual 2
million assembly-line circumcisions in this country are a
monument to the gullibility and stupidity of the American
public.
<P>
      For 60 years, a powerful and articulate minority in our
profession has tried to enforce a tabu against any objective
discussion of the merits or demerits of circumcision. Over in
Great Britain the climate of opinion is decidedly against
routine circumcision, but here the operation has become a
sacrament: To question its value has become all but
unthinkable. The medical literature is virtually closed except
to those who drool over the operation's alleged advantages.
<P>
      Still, once in a while dissident voices manage to be
heard. William Keith C. Morgan, M.D., of the University of
Maryland School of Medicine has written in the Journal of the
American Medical Association that "98 times out of 100 there
is no valid indication for this mutilation other than
religion. . . . Why is the operation of circumcision
practiced? One might as well attempt to explain the rites of
voodoo!" Peter Van Zante, M.D., of Iowa writes in the Medical
Tribune: "Circumcision of a helpless child is a crime."
Elsewhere he has said: "Circumcision is cruel and mutilating
and actually should be outlawed." In 1920, a British physician
named G. S. Thompson, who had once circumcised himself, later
concluded that circumcision was nothing more nor less than "a
barbarous and unnecessary mutilation" (British Medical
Journal, 1920).
<P>
      At this point, the reader may do well to examine his own
conscience. If he has been circumcised, either ritually or
surgically, and is chagrined that anyone would dare question
the advisability of circumcising every single male infant, let
him read no further. He has about as much chance of being
objective as he has of growing himself a new foreskin.
<P>
<center>* * *</center>
<P>
Efforts to justify circumcision have been made since the very
beginnings of history. The desire to mutilate came first; the
"reasons" came later, and run the gamut from spiritual through
cultural, esthetic, and finally medical.
<P>
      This process of rationalization has culminated in the
supposed relationship between the husband's foreskin and
cancer of the genitals -- one of the greatest hoaxes in the
history of medicine. The theory is that the uncircumcised
penis, because it may generate a waxy substance called smegma,
can produce cancer of the penis and cancer of the cervix (neck
of the womb).
<P>
      The only widespread evidence in support of this theory
is that Jewish men and Jewish women rarely get cancer of their
sexual organs.
<P>
      But granting that genital cancer is rare among Jews,
circumcision is almost certainly not the reason. As Dr. Van
Zante has observed, Jews in general seem to be more resistant
to certain diseases than gentiles and to have a greater
longevity: Genetic and cultural factors are probably at work.
Thus, Paul Sherlock, M.D., of the Cornell University Medical
College, is convinced that ulcerative colitis and regional
enteritis are <I>more</I> common among Jews because these diseases
have a genetic basis (Medical Tribune, 3/9/66).
<P>
      That the lower incidence of penile and cervical cancer
in Jews is genetic or cultural seems perfectly clear when one
examines the incidence of genital cancer in other ethnic
groups.
<P>
      In Finland, fewer than one man in a thousand is
circumcised, yet the incidence of penile cancer in Finnish men
is less than in Americans. Finnish women also have less cancer
of the cervix than American women.
<P>
      In Java, the Moslems are ritually circumcised, yet Java
has one of the highest incidences of cancer of the penis in
the world.
<P>
      In Ethiopia, Coptic women have a high incidence of
cervical cancer, although 90% of Coptic men are circumcised in
infancy.
<P>
      In India, the Parsees are not circumcised. Yet the
Parsees have one of the lowest incidences of penile and
cervical cancer in the world.
<P>
      Further evidence that circumcision is not linked with
cancer comes from tests of human smegma. In 1942, the National
Cancer Institute conducted careful experiments and found that
smegma had no carcinogenic effect whatsoever. This test was
duplicated in 1953 on a more extensive scale by Dr. D. G.
Reddy and others, with the same conclusions. Negative results
have also been obtained in a number of other experiments
("Circumcision in Infancy," Charles Weiss, M.D., Clinical
Pediatrics, 1964). In addition, if smegma <I>were</I> carcinogenic,
the use of a contraceptive sheath would lower the incidence of
cervical cancer in women. Studies have shown that it doesn't
(Journal of the American Medical Women's Association, 1962).
<P>
      Finally, control groups of circumcised and uncircumcised
gentiles have been studied, and cervical cancer has not been
correlated with the presence of absence of the foreskin in
male sexual partners (American Journal of Obstetrics and
Gynecology, 1958).
<P>
      Yet even if circumcision and penile cancer <I>were</I>
connected, this might not be justification enough to warrant
circumcision. As Dr. Morgan points out, "this is an uncommon
form of cancer and generally has a fairly good prognosis.
Appendicitis causes many more deaths every year in the United
States than does cancer of the penis, but nobody yet recommends
routine appendectomy." Dr. Van Zante gives a more graphic
analogy: "Why not amputate all female breasts to avoid mammary
cancer?"
<P>
      Well, does circumcision at least prevent venereal
disease? Thirty years ago, routine circumcision was being
urged for just this reason. Today, our circumcised teen-agers
have the highest V.D. rates in history. Dr. Morgan adds: "Any
U.S. or British physician with experience in North America or
the Levant [where circumcision is common] knows that the
Middle East has a venereal disease rate which is second to
none."
<P>
      Does circumcision prevent phimosis, the constriction of
the foreskin? The answer is yes, but the fact is that true
phimosis, as every physician knows, is extremely rare.
<P>
      Does circumcision lead to a more hygienic penis? The
answer, again, is yes. Except that the ears also collect dirt.
Should they also be lopped off? "Soap and water," writes Dr.
Morgan, "work wonders with the body's other orifices and
appendages, and there would seem to be no reason to doubt
their efficacy with respect to the foreskin." And while it is
true that genital cancer may someday be linked with lack of
cleanliness, Dr. Van Zante points out: "The male should be
taught cleanliness, and if he follows this, I doubt that the
uncircumcised male will contribute any greater percentage of
penile and cervical cancer than the circumcised male."
<P>
      Dr. Morgan's conclusion is the only conclusion possible:
"There are a variety of reasons advanced in favor of
circumcision, most of which are unconvincing when critically
examined."
<P>
<center>* * *</center>
<P>
Since circumcision has practically nothing to recommend it, an
important question is: Why has it become a routine operation?
A few physicians go so far as to suggest that money may have
something to do it. Dr. Van Zante asks rhetorically: "Don't
you think that the doctor delivering the baby thinks more
about the $10 or $15 surgical fee he'll get than the possible
after-effects?"
<P>
      My own view is: Circumcision provides a convenient and
socially acceptable outlet for the perverted component of the
circumciser's libido. I have had person experience with the
psychopathology that underlies the wish to circumcise. The
pitiful wails of the suffering infant are all too often the
background for lewd and obscene commentary by the obstetrician
to his audience of nurses. Several years ago I saw an infant
born with multiple deformities. He could not live more than a
few months at most, but to add to his miseries, this unfortunate
bit of humanity had to undergo a thorough circumcision.
<P>
      I have seen two medical students fight over the privilege
of doing circumcision on the newborn, although these same
students showed neither interest nor aptitude for opening
boils or doing other surgical tasks.
<P>
      In 1951, I witnessed an autopsy on an infant who had
died from an infected circumcision -- a death rendered even
more tragic because the mother had tried to persuade the
obstetrician to spare her infant this ordeal.
<P>
      Dr. Alexander Schaffer, a noted pediatrician, tells with
horror the case in which an infant was being delivered as a
frank breech (buttocks first). Before delivering the baby, and
just as the penis came into view, the obstetrician seized it
and circumcised it. That obstetrician, I would say, may be
capable. He may be an all-round fine fellow. But sexually I
say he is a monster. And I say that one of the reasons why
circumcision is so common in this country stems from the
sadism of the crypto-pervert.
<P>
      My viewpoint is not very novel, though, for
psychiatrists have long agreed that circumcision is basically
a punitive act. According to Dr. Menninger, for instance, the
original and basic purpose of circumcision was to serve as a
symbol of castration, and the practice was initiated by
fathers -- to punish their sons for whatever incestuous
feelings they might have for their mothers.
<P>
      Another explanation for the prevalence of circumcision:
latent female antagonism toward the penis. To quote Dr.
Morgan: "Perhaps not the least of the reasons why American
mothers seem to endorse the operation with such enthusiasm is
the fact that it is one way an intensely matriarchal society
can permanently influence the physical characteristics of its
males." I myself do not doubt that among the biggest boosters
of circumcision are neurotic females, whose unhappy sex lives
prompt them to injure a man where he feels it the most.
<P>
      One could go further and consider the obstetrician:
Perhaps the same stimulus that drove him into the
traditionally feminine role of midwife is also responsible for
his attack upon the penis. However, in all fairness, it should
be pointed out that these male midwives know very little about
the penis and, of all physicians, are surely the least competent
to decide about circumcision. Besides, the obstetricians rarely
sees the hemorrhage, the infection, and the deformities that
sometimes result from his handiwork -- these are the lot of the
emergency-room staff, the pediatrician, the urologist, and the
plastic surgeon.
<P>
      Others who can be counted on the side of the circumcisers
are:
<P>
      A. Certain Christian clergymen, who are quick to point
out that Jesus Christ submitted to circumcision. (They are not
so quick to point out that Jesus also submitted to crucifixion.)
The Roman Catholic Church solemnly celebrates the Feast of the
Circumcision on January 1.
<P>
      B. Homosexuals, who -- according to psychiatrists -- are
in dire fear of being castrated. No doubt it pleases them when
others, instead of themselves, submit to an operation that is
similar.
<P>
      C. Anti-Semitic Jews, ashamed of their mark and eager to
make it universal.
<P>
      D. All men, including physicians, who have already been
circumcised. To paraphrase an expression, they suffer from
"foreskin envy." Cut off a man's tonsils and it does not
affect his feelings toward his neighbor's tonsils, but cut off
his foreskin and his neighbor's foreskin becomes an object of
envy and hatred. The circumcised have always behaved as if
their circumcision were a stigma of inferiority. Jew, Moor,
and Turk forced circumcision on servants, slaves, and whole
nations of conquered people.
<P>
      Because the motivations of the foreskin-phobes are so
irrational, these people are hard to combat. The introduction
of routine circumcision as a "medical" measure at the turn of
the century aroused vigorous opposition within the profession.
Dr. Warren Stone Bickham, an eminent surgeon, declared that
circumcision was a disgrace and a discredit to the surgeon
responsible. Nonetheless by 1930 the opposition had dwindled,
and the fanatical circumcisers were in possession of the
field. The opponents of circumcision failed because they did
not understand the motives of the circumcisers and therefore
could not grapple with them.
<P>
<center>* * *</center>
<p>
So far I have considered the "medical benefits" of circumcision
and explored the possible motives of those who favor
circumcision. Now I want to consider the harmful consequences of
the operation.
<P>
      The circumcision of a newborn boy is a spectacle so
appalling and revolting in its cruelty that, on their first
encounter with the ordeal, many robust medical students faint.
The infant is tied down securely to a circumcision board, with
his genitals exposed. Next, the entire foreskin and much of
the penile skin is pulled through a clamp, and as the clamp's
screw is tightened, the skin is crushed off. As much as 80% of
the total penile skin is removed. In this country anesthetics
are rarely used. The infant struggles and screams, and often
vomits and defecates, before lapsing into unconsciousness.
<P>
      As a result of circumcision, some infants die. Countless
others are doomed to become sexual cripples. In 1958 a 4-year-
old boy underwent surgery for an undescended testicle. The
surgeon, noticing that the child still had his foreskin, just
couldn't pass up this tidbit. The circumcision failed to heal,
and 5 days later the penis sloughed off. The parents sued for
$150,000 and settled for $80,000. In a similar case last year,
the parents asked for $4,500,000. These are two cases that have
come to public attention because of lawsuits. In England and
Wales, however, it is known that an average of 16 children died
annually from 1942 to 1947 as a direct result of circumcision.
<P>
      Dr. Van Zante has this to say: "Proponents of circumcision
do not mention any of the ill-effects of circumcision. Duf and
Ware state, 'Major losses of penile skin are fairly common as a
complication of circumcision.' The child may get a meatal ulcer.
The sensitive, exposed glans [the head of the penis] sometimes
becomes infected with diaper rash.... Occasionally a babe,
especially of hemophiliac parents, bleeds to death."
<P>
      Dr. Weiss mentions these other possible complications:
sepsis, eczema of the glans and meatus, meatal stenosis,
surgical adhesions, interference with nutrition, edema of
local tissue, seepage of blood with resulting anemia, and
injuries of the glans or scrotal skin.
<P>
      Dr. John Van Duyn of Georgia, a plastic surgeon, has
complained that often circumcisions are performed by young
interns, and after they perform a few circumcisions, they are
left unsupervised. "Unless the operator is competent and care
is exercised," he writes, "there is always the possibility of
damage from poor technique."
<P>
      Dr. Can Duyn goes on: "A short time ago, I was called
upon to split-graft the penis of a newborn where too much skin
had been inadvertently removed, and in reporting this case found
that this error had occurred in a number of other instances.
<P>
      "In another case, involving incorrect use of a circumcision
clamp in an infant, the glans was found gangrenous on removal of
the clamp and was subsequently lost."
<P>
      "There is also the danger from hemorrhage, especially if
the baby is placed in a prone position and supervision is
minimal, In a near fatality from this cause, of which I have
firsthand knowledge ... a growing puddle of blood beneath the
baby was not discovered for a considerable time.
<P>
<center>* * *</center>
<P>
Another hazard of circumcision is the possible diminution of
sexual pleasure. Only the circumcised refer to the foreskin as
a "useless appendage." The intact penis is an instrument
admirably suited for its natural purpose -- which is <I>not</I> simply
to serve as a waterspout.
<P>
      During a boy's growth, the foreskin protects the sensitive
glans. Normally the surface of the glans is composed of a smooth,
glistening membrane only a few cells in thickness. The surface
cells are alive, and naked nerve-endings are distributed among
these cells. After circumcision, this membrane becomes 10 times
thicker, and the free nerve-endings disappear. The surface
becomes covered with an adherent layer of dead cells, rough, dry,
and insensitive.
<P>
      For the mature man, the foreskin provides a covering during
erection, and the organ increases in bulk from six to eight
times. In coitus, it rolls back to expose the sensitive glans.
And especially when the vagina is snug, this elastic covering
promotes sexual satisfaction: It enables the penis to penetrate
smoothly and without friction.
<P>
      A number of students have confirmed that the uncircumcised
man has a sexual advantage over the circumcised. For instance,
Martin L. Edwards Sr., M.D., a Texas physician, writes: "I have
counselled with many married men who are circumcised, and this
alone has been a great drawback between man and wife."
<P>
      On the other hand, Dr. William H. Masters and Virginia
E. Johnson, in their recent book Human Sexual Response, call
it a "phallic fallacy" to believe that the man who is circumcised
is at a sexual disadvantage. But a close reading of their book
makes their conclusion seem erroneous.
<P>
      To begin with, they maintain that it is a widespread belief
that the uncircumcised man has better ejaculatory control than
the man who is circumcised -- because his glans is <I>less</I>
sensitive than the circumcised man's. Medical opinion, actually,
is the opposite: The man with his original foreskin has a glans
that is <I>particularly</I> sensitive.
<P>
      In their book they also state: "A limited number of the
male study-subject population was exposed to a brief clinical
experiment designed to prove the false premise of excessive
sensitivity of the circumcised glans." Experiments on 35 men
in each category demonstrated no "clinically significant
difference" in sensitivity of the glans.
<P>
      Let me suggest that when an experiment "is designed to
prove the false premise" of some belief or other, even if it
uses a "limited" number of subject in a "brief" experiment,
its outcome is really not in doubt.
<P>
      Aside from its lack of objectivity, the basic fault of
he experiment Dr. Masters and Mrs. Johnson describe is that no
mention is made of when the circumcised men were circumcised.
The fact is that if circumcision is delayed until adult life,
degenerative changes are minimal. The glans does not suffer
such a profound loss of sensitivity, and the penis gets a
"tailored fit." But even if there is no sexual advantage to
having one's original foreskin, and even were complications
not so numerous, there would still be other dangers attendant
upon circumcision -- psychological dangers.
<P>
      The reason that anesthetics are rarely used on infants
undergoing circumcision is that -- in addition to the possible
danger -- it has been taken for granted that infants are not
sensitive to pain. Recent experiments, and contemporary opinion,
however, flatly contradict this.
<P>
      Charles Weiss, M.D., of the Albert Einstein Medical Center
in Philadelphia, states: "Experimental psychologists and
psychologists who employed the techniques of pin-pricking or
applied medical electric shock to different part of the body have
demonstrated that sensitivity in neonates increases sharply
within the first four days of life."
<P>
      A Leipzig pediatrician, Prof. A Peiper, states: "I have
not the slightest doubt that a newborn infant is definitely
sensitive to pain."
<P>
      A London physician, A. W. Wilkinson, M.D., states: "I do
not think there is any doubt that infants in the first week of
life are sensitive to pain because, when inadequately
anesthetized, they respond very sharply to incision with a
knife."
<P>
      Since infants apparently do feel the pain of circumcision,
no wonder that a number of psychiatrists -- including Freud --
have held that circumcision must leave scars on the personality.
Recently, Dr. Rene A. Spitz observed: "I find it difficult to
believe that circumcision, as practiced in our hospitals, would
not represent stress and shock of some kind. Nobody who has
witnessed the way these infants are operated on without
anesthesia, the infant screaming in manifest pain, can reasonably
deny that such treatment is likely to leave traces of some kind
on the personality. This is one of the cruelties the medical
profession thoughtlessly inflicts on infants, just because these
cannot tell what they suffer."
<P>
      One possible result of circumcision is impotence: Impotence
seems to be frequent in circumcised men, but rare among the
uncircumcised. Problem-masturbation is also as common among the
circumcised as it is rare among the uncircumcised -- the exposed
glans explains it.
<P>
      Then too, homosexuality also seems to be related to
circumcision. First to report this was Melitta Schmideberg
(Psychoanalytic Review, 1948), who treated two patients,
homosexuals, who had been circumcised. In one of them, "The
resentment and fear of his mother associated with circumcision
was an important factor in the development of his
homosexuality." More recently, a study was made of admissions
to a large Naval hospital. Of all admissions, 32% had been
circumcised. Of all admission with the diagnosis of "overt
homosexuality," <I>100% had been circumcised</I>. Before he died,
Dr. Alfred Kinsey intended to investigate the relationship
between circumcision and homosexuality.
<P>
      Unfortunately, one cannot be sure about all the possible
psychological illnesses that can be traced back to circumcision.
As Dr. Spitz has observed, "Characteristically, no research seems
ever to have been done on developmental and personality
differences between a group of circumcised and one of
uncircumcised infants."
<P>
<center>* * *</center> 
<P>
Finally, in addition to the physical and psychological harm
done by circumcision, there is the social harm.
<P>
      It is a truism in psychoanalytic literature that
circumcision is a major cause of anti-Semitism.
<P>
      Circumcision, in the unconscious, is confused with
castration. Thus, in Man Against Himself, Dr. Menninger writes:
"I could cite many illustrations from psychiatric practice to
show how, in the unconscious, circumcision and castration are
equated. Because the fear of cutting in connection with the
genitals is so widespread, and apparently so basic in the
formation of character, any surgery in connection with the
genitals is apt to be associated with strong emotional feeling
which psychoanalysts, on the basis of their daily experiences
with the language of the unconscious, ascribe to the 'castration
threat,' i.e., the fear that the genitals are to be irremediably
injured."
<P>
      How do the Jews fit in? To impressionable Christian
children, circumcision is considered mutilation of the
genitals -- and Jews are identified with the practice. Freud
himself thought that the castration complex was "the deepest
unconscious root of anti-Semitism; for even in the nursery
little boys hear that a Jew has something cut off his penis."
<P>
      Not surprisingly, in-depth interviews with antisemites
have revealed that many of them have a deep fear of being
castrated. Some 100 anti-Semitic students studied by Else
Frenkel-Brunswik and R. Nevitt (Anti-Semitism: A Social
Disease, 1946) betrayed "unconscious inferiority feelings
centering mainly about the castration complex." To them,, the
Jews, the symbol of the circumciser-castrator, automatically
became an object of hate and fear. Dr. Nathan W. Ackerman, and
Anti-Semitism and Emotional Disorder (1950), cites a patient
who told him: "I can't understand why so many gentiles are
circumcised. That's what the Jews did to America. Their
mission is to circumcise every single Christian in the
country." Asked by a Fact staffer if he had been circumcised,
Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell became upset: "I won't
answer any such degrading question as that." Rockwell evinced
his ready confusion of circumcision and castration by adding:
"As far as the Jews are concerned, it isn't thorough enough.
They should cut about 5 inches more off."
<P>
      Many psychiatrists, Jews among them, are therefore eager
that Jews give up the practice of circumcision. C.G.
Schoenfeld, writing in Psychoanalytic Review (1966),
acknowledges that because circumcision is a "fundamental tenet
of Judaism ... Jews can hardly be expected to renounce
circumcision readily -- or indeed at all." But he goes on:
<P>
Nevertheless, the tenets of religion do change (consider, for
example, the results of the recent Ecumenical Council of the
Catholic Church). Hence, it is conceivable that knowing that
circumcision helps engender anti-Semitism will have an effect
upon Jews, and as a result, upon Judaism -- especially if Jews
also familiarize themselves with certain anthropological and
psychoanalytic studies and discoveries regarding circumcision.
<P>
      For one thing, Jews ought to be aware that circumcision,
far from being a uniquely Jewish custom, was once a common
practice in ancient Egypt ... and, in addition, that
circumcision is to this very day a common practice among many
of the world's primitive peoples.
<P>
<center>* * *</center>
<P>
To recapitulate: Circumcision has few if any medical benefits.
Any link between circumcision and the prevention of genital
cancer is at best unproved. Circumcision is not only
unnecessary but barbaric. It can cripple children, both
physically and mentally, for their whole lives. And as for the
motives behind circumcision, psychiatrists are agreed that
they are irrational and punitive.
<P>
      What can be done?
<P>
      One possible course is to wait until the physicians in
this country become well-informed on the subject. However, a
fascinating survey conducted a few years ago (American Journal
of Diseases in Children, 1963) and 126 physicians in Ohio
revealed that 69% favored routine circumcision, 20% opposed
it, and 11% were of the opinion that circumcision was not a
"medical" decision and should rest with the parents.
<P>
      The men who conducted the survey -- Robert A Shaw and W.
O. Robertson, M.D. -- were quick to point out that none of the
reasons given were firmly established, and many were
imaginary. "The results," they concluded, "cast reasonable
doubt on the belief that the decision -- 'pro' or 'con' -- is
reached in any scientific manner."
<P>
      The authors also were skeptical that the medical men
will, in the near future, make themselves better informed on
the subject. "One would hope," they write, "the situation
might change in the next century -- but do not bet on it!"
<P>
      Another survey the authors conducted was of parents who
let their children be circumcised. What were their reasons? I
quote a few: "Thought it was a mandatory hospital procedure";
"Because it 'looks better'"; "Thought all males were
circumcised"; "Everyone in our family is circumcised"; "I
thought it was a law"; and "The doctor just did it."
<P>
      Still, at the present time I think that it is parents
who are our best hope. It is they who can campaign for a more
open discussion of the problem. It is they who can prevent
their sons from being circumcised. And it is, therefore, to
parents that I appeal:
<P>
      Let us be honest and fair enough to let our sons grow up
to decide for themselves if they want to exchange their
foreskins for the very dubious advantages of circumcision.
<P>
      And I would like to remind parents of that perceptive
remark of the great historian Henry Thomas Buckle: "Every
great reform which has been effected has consisted, not in
doing something new, but in undoing something old."
