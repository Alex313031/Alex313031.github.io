<br>"In cases of masturbation we must, I believe, break the habit
by
inducing such a condition of the parts as will cause too much
local suffering to allow of the practice being continued. For
this purpose, if the prepuce is long, we may circumcise the male 
patient with present
and probably with future advantage; the operation, too, should
<I>not</I> be performed under chloroform, so that the pain
experienced
may be associated with the habit we wish to eradicate."

<br>"A remedy [for masturbation] which is almost always

a surgeon without administering an anesthetic, as the pain
attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the
mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment."

<P><b>1891</b> 
<br>"In consequence of circumcision the epithelial covering of
the
glans becomes dry, hard, less liable to excoriation and
inflammation, and less pervious to venereal viruses. The
sensitivity of the glans is diminished, but not sufficiently to
interfere with the copulative function of the organ or to
constitute an objection ... It is well authenticated that the
foreskin ... is a fruitful cause of the habit of masturbation in
children ... I conclude that the foreskin is detrimental to
health, and that circumcision is a wise measure of hygiene."

confirmed derangement of the digestive organs, restlessness,
irritability, and other disturbances of the nervous system, even

waste the nutritive facilities of the general system are below

considered as among the lines of treatment to be pursued."

<br>"In all cases of masturbation circumcision is undoubtedly the
physicians' closest friend and ally ... To obtain the best
results one must cut away enough skin and mucous membrane to
rather put it on the stretch when erections come later. There
must be no play in the skin after the wound has thoroughly
healed, but it must fit tightly over the penis, for should there
be any play the patient will be found to readily resume his
practice, not begrudging the time and extra energy required to
produce the orgasm. It is true, however, that the longer it takes
to have an orgasm, the less frequently it will be attempted,
consequently the greater the benefit gained ... The younger the
patient operated upon the more pronounced the benefit, though
occasionally we find patients who were circumcised before puberty
that require a resection of the skin, as it has grown loose and
pliant after that epoch." <small><b>E. J. Spratling, Masturbation

<br>"Finally, circumcision probably tends to increase the power
of sexual control. The only physiological advantages which the
prepuce can be supposed to confer is that of maintaining the
penis in a condition susceptible to more acute sensation than
would otherwise exist. It may increase the pleasure of coition
and the impulse to it: but these are advantages which in the
present state of society can well be spared. If in their loss,
increase in sexual control should result, one should be
thankful."

<P><b>1900</b> 
<br>"It has been urged as an argument against the universal
adoption
of circumcision that the removal of the protective covering of
the glans tends to dull the sensitivity of that exquisitely
sensitive structure and thereby diminishes sexual appetite and
the pleasurable effects of coitus. Granted that this be true, my
answer is that, whatever may have been the case in days gone by,
sensuality in our time needs neither whip nor spur, but would be
all the better for a little more judicious use of curb and
bearing-rein." <small><b>E. Harding Freeland, Circumcision as a

<P><b>1901</b> 
<br>"Another advantage of circumcision ... is the lessened
liability
to masturbation. A long foreskin is irritating per se, as it
necessitates more manipulation of the parts in bathing ... This
leads the child to handle the parts, and as a rule, pleasurable
sensations are elicited from the extremely sensitive mucous
membrane, with resultant manipulation and masturbation. The
exposure of the glans penis following circumcision ... lessens
the sensitiveness of the organ ... It therefore lies with the
physician, the family adviser in affairs hygienic and medical, to
urge its acceptance." <small><b>Ernest G. Mark, Circumcision,

<br>"Circumcision promotes cleanliness, prevents disease, and by
reducing oversensitiveness of the parts tends to relieve sexual
irritability, thus correcting any tendency which may exist to
improper manipulations of the genital organs and the consequent
acquirement of evil sexual habits, such as masturbation." <small><b>Lydston

<P><b>1914</b> 
<br>"It is generally accepted that irritation derived from a
tight
prepuce may be followed by nervous phenomena, among these being
convulsions and epilepsy. It is therefore not at all improbable
that in many infants who die in convulsions the real cause of
death is a long or tight prepuce. The foreskin is a frequent
factor in the causation of masturbation ... Circumcision offers a
diminished tendency to masturbation, nocturnal pollutions,
convulsions and other nervous results of local irritation. It is
the moral duty of every physician to encourage circumcision in
the young." <small><b>Abraham L. Wolbarst, Universal Circumcision,

<P><b>1915</b> 
<br>"Circumcision not only reduces the irritability of the
child's
penis, but also the so-called passion of which so many married
men are so extremely proud, to the detriment of their wives and
their married life. Many youthful rapes could be prevented, many
separations, and divorces also, and many an unhappy marriage
improved if this unnatural passion was cut down by a timely
circumcision." <small><b>L. W. Wuesthoff, Benefits of

<br>"The prepuce is one of the great factors in causing
masturbation
in boys. Here is the dilemma we are in: If we do not teach the
growing boy to pull the prepuce back and cleanse the glans there
is the danger of smegma collecting and of adhesions and
ulcerations forming, which in their turn will cause irritation
likely to lead to masturbation. If we do teach the boy to pull
the prepuce back and cleanse his glans, that handling alone is
sufficient gradually and almost without the boy's knowledge to
initiate him into the habit of masturbation ... Therefore, off
with the prepuce!" <small><b>William J. Robinson, Circumcision and

matter." <small><b>I. Solomons, For and Against Circumcision,

cases ... Hemorrhage following circumcision at birth cannot be

<P><b>1935: 55% of the U.S. male population circumcised</b> 
<br>"I suggest that all male children should be circumcised. This is
'against nature', but that is exactly the reason why it should be
done. Nature intends that the adolescent male shall copulate as
often and as promiscuously as possible, and to that end covers
the sensitive glans so that it shall be ever ready to receive
stimuli. Civilization, on the contrary, requires chastity, and
the glans of the circumcised rapidly assumes a leathery texture
less sensitive than skin. Thus the adolescent has his attention
drawn to his penis much less often. I am convinced that
masturbation is much less common in the circumcised. With these
considerations in view it does not seem apt to argue that 'God
knows best how to make little boys.'" <small><b>R. W. Cockshut,

<P>"As editor of a newspaper dedicated to infectious diseases,
you
know that antibiotics are the standard of care for infection and
that surgery is a last resort for body parts for which there is
no other cure. Perpetrating sexual surgery on healthy
non-consenting minors, under the legal age of informed consent or
refusal, to purportedly prevent an unlikely and curable future
infection, is unacceptable. Intentionally amputating healthy
erogenous genital tissue from tethered, protesting infants is a
surgical act of sexual sadism.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaiser Foundation's
Edgar Schoen ignores the erogenous benefits
of the foreskin and a man's birthright to the sexual fulfillment
he was born to experience. He would do well to stop promoting and
perpetrating sexual surgery. He withholds from parents, who have
no ethical right to consent to unnecessary sexually disendowing
surgery on their children, the fact that the foreskin has sexual
and erogenous functions. He contends that circumcision protects
against sexually transmitted disease!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dr. Schoen's failed
attempt to justify surgical genital abuse is a willful act of
misrepresentation. It is a disgrace and
discredit to the medical profession and <I>Infectious Diseases in
Children</I>. It is imperative that you also remove this tainted
material to minimize liability to this publication from harmed
patients, especially circumcised victims who developed AIDS in
spite of being circumcised. Beyond patient harm, beyond medical
ethics, publishing misinformation is a licensing and disciplinary
issue of grave import to all involved."
