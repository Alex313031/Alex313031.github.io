Letter from Carla Miller to Hillary Rodham Clinton

November 7, 1998

<P>Purpose: Seek Assistance from the White House

<P>Topic: Human Rights

<P>Subject: Bad Medicine as Torture, Mayhem, and Murder

<P>Dear Hillary Rodham Clinton,

<P>My heart goes out to you for your own pain at having your private life
brought before the public. I find it very frustrating that U.S. law,
government, and media focus on this while completely ignoring that the
United States of America allows its doctors to torture, and maim, and kill
innocent patients. Our leaders ignore us, letting bad doctors go on to
violate others.

<P>I'm not writing to you about "mistakes," "accidents," "mishaps," or "poor
results." I'm telling you that the United States is a genitally mutilating
country, and I'm writing to ask who is responsible for investigating claims
that these and other mutilations are being done, and that there is no way
for patients to stop it because they don't know that doctors are doing it --
not until it's already too late.

<P>One sexual mutilation victim who wrote to the White House was referred to
the Department of Health and Human Services, where she was referred back to
her state medical board where she had already gone, and had gotten no relief
whatsoever -- but where her medical records were conveniently "lost."  This
is a common problem.

<P>She's dead now. She killed herself last December. But there are many
others.

<P>Please, where can American citizens report these crimes, and have real
investigations, and fair hearings, and finally, some semblance of justice
for their pain and suffering?

<P>Can you help? We're coming to Washington, DC, looking for help. We need the
name of whoever looks into these very serious matters.  We need incomplete
investigations reinvestigated by authorities who care about the truth.

<P>I once heard former Governor Mario Cuomo say, "We have to ask the real
questions to the real problems so that we can have real solutions."  That's
what patients need.

<P>Please help.
