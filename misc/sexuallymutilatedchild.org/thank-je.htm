In all my years of academic research, I have never come across a
source of information -- on any topic -- as powerful, insightful,
thorough, and thought-provoking as your website on circumcision.
Most websites provide selected parcels of information to specific
target groups. Your website provides the broadest range of 
information on this topic I have ever encountered. It is a
treasure trove of information.

<P>You do not descriminate, suppress, edit, expurgate, or censor.
Consequently, yours is the only website I am aware of that 
exposes the dark, chilling undercurrents that run through the
history of circumcision.

<P>With their calculated, deceptive rhetoric, the perpetrators of
this atrocity attempt to draw links between an obvious horror and
positive abstractions such as "tradition," "religion," "science,"
"medicine," and "hygiene." The documents and essays on your
website, however, expose this charade and show what the sexual
mutilation of children is really about: 
envy, lust, hatred, male sexual rivalry, sadism,
criminal psychopathology, desperation, ruthlessness, 
power, control, oppression, violence, contempt for humanity, 
and greed.

<P>It is about time that more human rights activists followed
your
lead and refused to play the circumcisers' game of evading the
real issues. As your website makes clear, circumcision is not
really about medicine or public health. Circumcision is not
really about preventing or curing any disease. Circumcisers are
not mistaken in their medical beliefs; they are lying.
Circumcision advocacy is really about weaving a convincing
network of lies to deflect the attention of the public and the
criminal justice system from the frightening truth that
circumcisers are really criminally deranged, psychotic,
knife-wielding maniacs driven by psychopathic obsessions and
compulsions that most people could never understand. 

<P>Would any
normal person -- would any normal doctor -- pick up a knife and
cut, slash, crush, burn, rip, tear, bloody, and savage a child's
healthy sex organs? Would any normal, healthy adult allow someone
to do that to him? To cover their tracks and to protect their
immunity from being imprisoned for their grisly
crimes, circumcisers are waging a war of terror, oppression, and
violence against the United States and all other countries where
they have infiltrated the corridors of power. Your website
documents these disturbing facts.

<P>Thank you, John Erickson, for having the courage to expose
these
frenzied, shrieking, hate-driven fanatics who, blinded by the
sudden light of honest inquiry, now find themselves caught in a
satanic orgy of torture and mutilation involving countless
millions of child victims. They may have escalated their campaign
of lies and terror in recent months, in response to the American
Academy of Pediatrics' 1999 Statement on Circumcision, but thanks
to dedicated scholars and humanitarians like you, the days are
numbered for penis-slashers like Schoen, Weiss, Halperin, Moses,
Kogan, Kunin, Schechet, Bailey, Russell, Wiswell, and the army of
cowards and fools who blindly and slavishly do their bidding.
