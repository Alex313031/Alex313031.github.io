<b>Ode to My Husband's Missing Foreskin</b>

<P>I never knew you. I wish I had.
<br>Someone said you were bad.

<P>Ripped you off before you were complete,
<br>thought that bare glans looked so neat.

<P>Now we deal with wet against dry
<br>and rely on KY.

<P>How much fun it would have been
<br>to slide you back and forth again.

<P>And see the pleasure in his eyes
<br>as his pressure starts to rise.

<P>Circumcision robs more than one
<br>of the perfect design for fun.

<P>He doesn't miss what he never had,
<br>so why does it make me so sad?

<P>--Anonymous
