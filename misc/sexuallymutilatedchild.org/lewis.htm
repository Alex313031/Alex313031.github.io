<blockquote>
"It is the duty of society to protect us from the brutality of 
tribal law. In man's progress
from his primitive state to modern civilization, the great 
civilizing force is the humanizing of our
savage instincts and the restraining of our brutal actions ... in 
many instances the brutality and
pain inflicted upon children ... do not compare, in violence, with 
the callous brutality and torture
inflicted upon harmless infants during circumcision. Because of 
the religious association of
circumcision, a helpless infant is made the victim of a brutal 
sacrifice by the religiously blind, the
superstitiously cruel and the morally sadistic. Yet, these heartless 
people, by wearing the cloak of
religion, not only protect themselves from molestation, but also 
from responsibility for their dastardly
deeds ... were circumcision proposed today for the first time ... 
its proposer would be looked
upon as a lunatic fit only for the insane asylum. If it were proposed 
for the first time today as a
religious rite, it would be summarily dismissed as superstitious 
savagery ... Such a proposal ...
would be treated with the same contempt as would a suggestion that 
a child's toes or fingers be
cut off ... Hundreds of brutal acts which man brought up from his 
savage state, and which bore
the stamp of religion, have fortunately gone out of existence, due 
to the enlightenment of the human
mind. This has been accomplished, however, only in the face of bitter 
opposition ... I condemn
circumcision as a survival of one of the insanities of religion based 
upon the ignorance and
superstition of primitive man ... circumcision is a brutal and savage 
rite, without value and
without one redeeming feature of recommend it. If the facts presented 
in this book are not sufficient
to convince some readers that circumcision should be abolished, I can 
only say that there exist
among us some hopeless people whose mentality is so paralyzed by the 
narcotic of religion that
nothing can arouse it from its state of lethargy. But to the others, 
to those who have some regard
for mankind, who believe that innocent and helpless children should be 
defended and protected from
the savage brutality and cruel mutilation of circumcision, then to 
them I cry, with all the power and
strength that I possess, with all the vehemence at my command, and 
from the deepest recesses of
my heart, Stop, in the name of Humanity, Stop!"
