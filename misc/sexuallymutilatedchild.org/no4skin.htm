<I>A man recalls his thoughts and feelings as a child over
60 years ago when he realized that part of his penis
had been cut off. Distilled by John Erickson from
correspondence with a man in Texas. Published in the
Fall 1986 issue (#6) of </I>Foreskin Quarterly.

<P>My parents never used the word "penis"
because it wasn't in the Bible. They used the word
"foreskin" instead. This caused me endless confusion.

<P>When I was about seven I asked my mother
why my "foreskin" always stuck out but my older
brother's didn't (since the head of his penis was
covered with skin but mine was always exposed).

<P>"Oh, don't you remember?" she said. "The
doctor sewed your foreskin so it would stay back."

<P>To my young mind something that was only
sewed could become unsewed. I would ask her, "When
is the doctor going to unsew my foreskin?" But she
always turned my questions off, never telling me the
truth.

<P>When I was nine a house was being built
near ours. One afternoon, when the men had quit for
the day, the man who ran the steam shovel asked me
if I'd like to see how it worked. Naturally, I was
thrilled. I climbed on and he showed me all about it.
He was about 40, a smooth talker, and somehow
quickly got onto the subject of "skin."

<P>He asked, "Can you slip your skin all the
way back? Does it ever pull tight or hurt?"

<P>I didn't know how to answer him because,
unlike my father and brother, I had no skin to slip
back; but I managed to say, "The doctor sewed my
foreskin so it stays back all the time."

<P>He said, "I've never seen a foreskin that was
sewn back."

<P>Anxious to understand what had been done
to me, I said, "I'll show you my foreskin if you'll show
me yours." (He had no way to know I really meant
"penis.")

<P>"Sure," he said, "I'll show you my foreskin.
Let's see yours first."

<P>I opened my pants and took my roughcut little 
penis out. I was watching his eyes and saw his 
astonishment as he said, "I've never seen a foreskin
sewn back like that." 

<P>Then he took his penis out, the head completely
covered with skin. "See <I>my</I> foreskin?" he asked.

<P>I could see it all right!

<P>He slipped the skin back slowly until the
head was exposed, and said, "I can make mine look
like yours too. See yours? See the scar all around it?"

<P>Yes, I could see it clearly. "That's where I
was sewed," I said.

<P>"Son," he said gently, "you are circumcised."

<P>"Oh no, I'm not," I said bravely. "I'm a
Christian. I'm not a Jew." (I had heard in Sunday
school that Jewish boys were circumcised and
Christian boys were baptized.)

<P>"See the little marks going all around?" he asked.

<P>"Yes," I said.

<P>"That's where you were sewed. Look here."
He pulled gently on the skin of the shaft but it was
too tight to move. "See?" he said. "There's no loose
skin like mine." Then he slipped his foreskin back and
forth over the head of his penis and I could see
<I>exactly</I> what had been done to me. I could see that
<I>that</I> part of me had been <I>cut</I> OFF!

<P>I panicked.

<P>"When will my foreskin grow back???" I asked.

<P>"Son," he said softly, "it will never grow
back. You are circumcised, and you will always be
circumcised. Nothing can ever change that. <I>You have
no foreskin</I>."

<P>I was too stunned to speak. I burst into
tears. I didn't want him to see me cry. I climbed down
and ran until I was out of sight. I was so enraged I
couldn't talk. The people I had trusted had told me all
those lies about being "sewed," and I realized I would
be <I>cut</I> like that -- an amputee -- for the rest of my
life.

<P>I went back the next day but the steam
shovel was gone, and I never saw the man again.

<P>I never told my mother I knew she had lied
to me. I couldn't make myself talk about it. Several
times I worked up the courage, but when I opened my
mouth to speak, the words stuck in my throat and no
sound came out.

<P>That was over 60 years ago, but I remember
it as clearly as if it happened yesterday   and the
words, "You have no foreskin," still resound in my
head.
