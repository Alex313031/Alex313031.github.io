<H2><I>Does</I> Male Circumcision Help Spread AIDS?</h2> 
</center>

<br>

The drawing on the cover of your May issue shows a woman saying,
"Yes, let's make love. But I'm concerned about AIDS. How do you
feel about safe sex?," and the man she's talking to replying,
"Hey, don't worry, I've been <I>circumcised</I>."

<P>It might make just slightly more sense for him to say, "Hey,
don't worry, my foreskin is intact."

<P>Of all the charges leveled against the human foreskin throughout
its long, tortured history, none is more frightening -- and none
warrants closer scrutiny -- than the ongoing, well-publicized
charge that it predisposes its possessor and his sexual partners
to an early, slow, agonizing death -- to infection with the AIDS
virus. 

<P>Why have researchers and the media ignored the opposite, more
obvious possibility? 

<P>Most sexual transmission of the AIDS virus is from the thrusting
partner to the receiving partner at ejaculation during vaginal or
anal intercourse. 

<P>A penis with its foreskin intact -- an uncircumcised penis -- can
slip in and out of a vagina or rectum non-abrasively inside its
own slick sheath of sensitive, self-lubricating, <I>movable</I>
foreskin. A penis with its foreskin missing -- a dowel-like
circumcised penis -- can only scrape in and out. 

<P>A penis with its foreskin intact requires relatively gentle
thrusting -- and less time -- to ejaculate. A circumcised penis -
- its head keratinized, desensitized, and dry -- requires
rougher, more prolonged thrusting to experience the sensations
necessary to trigger ejaculation.

<P>(A prostitute who's had intercourse with literally thousands of
men told me that intercourse with a circumcised man and
intercourse with an uncircumcised man were two entirely different
experiences, that she could always tell from the feeling alone
whether a man was circumcised or uncircumcised, that circumcised
men took longer to ejaculate, and that they "have to work at
it.") 

<P>Which -- a penis with its foreskin intact or a penis with its
foreskin missing -- is more likely to cause the breaks, tears,
micro-fractures, fissures, abrasions, and lacerations in a vagina
or rectum through which the AIDS virus in the thrusting partner's
semen could enter the receiving partner's bloodstream? 

<P>And which is more likely to break a condom? 

<P><I>The United States has one of the highest male circumcision
rates and one of the highest HIV infection rates in the
world.</I>

<P>The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta (1-800-342-AIDS)
reports that as of June 1997, more than 612,000 cases of AIDS and
more than 379,000 AIDS-related deaths had been reported in the
U.S., that between 650,000 and 900,000 Americans were estimated
to be infected with the virus, and that AIDS was the second
leading cause of deaths among Americans between 25 and 44. [Date
and figures adjusted after I called the CDC April 4, 1998.] 

<P><I>Does</I> male circumcision contribute to the spread of AIDS?

<P><I>Isn't it time to find out?</I>

<P>One more question: If a positive correlation between AIDS and
circumcision were in fact established, would it be fully and
accurately reported by the media in this country, or, like so
many other facts about the foreskin and circumcision, would it be
distorted, censored, and suppressed?

<P>John A. Erickson 

<P>[I wrote this letter before seeing and hearing Peter Duesberg, author of
<I>Inventing the AIDS Virus</I> (Regnery, 1996), on <I>Tony
Brown's Journal</I>, mid-1996, then reading his book. Duesberg
contends that the virus called HIV is harmless and that AIDS
itself is not transmissible.]
