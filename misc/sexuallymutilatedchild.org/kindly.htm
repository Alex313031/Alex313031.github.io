Dear Dr. Schoen,

<P>It was with the greatest interest that I
listened to your debate with Marilyn Milos on KQED's
talk show, Forum, this morning. I want you to know
that I hold you in the highest regard as a distinguished
physician, neighbor, and human being. I must tell you,
however, that on the issue of routine infant
circumcision, we disagree.

<P>Routine circumcision is not a medical issue or
a social issue. It is a sexual issue and a Human Rights
issue. The American studies you cited prove nothing
except that the authors of those studies have a
pathological compulsion to cut off the foreskins of
little boys. What you were taught in medical school
about the foreskin and circumcision is incorrect. Had
you attended medical school in Europe, you would
have learned the value and functions of the foreskin.
Had you attended medical school in the U.S. in the
19th century, you would have been taught that
circumcision cures and prevents epilepsy, hip-joint
disease, bed-wetting, hydrocephalus, tuberculosis,
idiocy, malnutrition, and especially masturbation.

<P>It is through no fault of your own that you
have no experience with normal genitalia. An important
part of your manhood has been denied you. To
circumcise a male is to blind him sexually. An entire
spectrum of erotic sensation and sexual function has
been robbed from circumcised males, yet they have no
idea what they are missing. Nature's design for the
penis is an exquisite piece of engineering. The opening
and closing of the prepucial lips are a miracle of rich
and delicious erotic sensations. The foreskin truly is
the most erotically sensitive part of the penis and is
every male's birthright.

<P>I have every confidence that were your
prepuce magically restored to you, even for just ten
minutes, you would be so astounded at the beauty and
delight of having a normal, complete penis that you
would realize that there is no reason good enough to
sacrifice this gift of Nature or to take it from another
person. You would shout it from the roof tops. You
would stand before the American Medical Association,
before the United States Congress, and before the
United Nations and loudly defend every male's
universal human right to the intact body he is born
with. With your usual eloquence you would denounce
circumcision and proclaim the universal human rights
of body-ownership, autonomy, and self-determination.

<P>History will not remember kindly those who
advocate circumcision, and will include them with the
19th and early 20th century advocates and
practitioners of leeching, trepanning, clitoridectomy,
and castration. The rationalizations doctors in the U.S.
continue to invent for forcing circumcision on innocent
boys are little more than puritanical, Victorian, anti-
sexualist prudery hiding behind the mask of science.
Europeans see through this and scorn the United
States as barbaric and cruel. You have the intelligence
to free your mind of superstition and unscientific
notions. You could become a model of enlightenment
for your entire profession. Your noble example could
bring greater health, happiness, and justice to the
American people. Millions of American males would
grow up thanking you for denouncing forced genital
amputation and defending their natural right to the
most exquisitely pleasurable part of their body.

<P>You are a good, honorable, and
compassionate man, Dr. Schoen. I appeal to your
innate dignity and kindheartedness to re-evaluate what
you were taught about the normal human penis, to
rethink your position on circumcision with a renewed
respect for Nature, Mankind, and Human Rights, and
to align yourself with world medical opinion and
responsible medical ethics.

<P>Sincerely,

<P>[A man in California]

<P>P.S. You might seriously consider getting a copy of
Jim Bigelow's book, 
The Joy 
of Uncircumcising!, and
embarking upon a course of gentle, non-surgical
foreskin restoration. Restoration cannot give back the
erotogenic nerves amputated at birth, but can create a
more natural-looking penis. The restored foreskin would
function very much as the original would have, and as
a happy result, the glans would be protected and
rejuvenated, returning to a much higher and more
normal level of sensitivity.

<P>[Edgar J. Schoen, MD, is director of Regional Perinatal Screening, 
Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, 280 W. MacArthur Blvd., 
Oakland, CA 94611-5693. He was chairman of the American Academy of
Pediatrics 1989 Task Force on Circumcision and is the author of 
"Ode to the Circumcised Male" 
and several other published poems about foreskins and circumcision.]
