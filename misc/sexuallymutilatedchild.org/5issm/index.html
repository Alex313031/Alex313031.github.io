<big><b>Human Rights Award</b></big>
<br>The International Symposia on Sexual Mutilations presents its
HUMAN 
RIGHTS AWARD to ethicist Dr. Margaret Somerville for courageously
stating 
that male genital mutilation is as ethically wrong as female
genital mutilation, that non-therapeutic circumcision of baby
boys is 
criminal assault, and that our duty is "to protect those who
cannot 
protect themselves."
<P>
<br>

<big><b>International Symposia on Sexual Mutilations</b></big>
<br>The International Symnposia on Sexual Mutilations, a special
project 
of the National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource
Centers 
(NOCIRC), provides a forum for discussion about the sexual
mutilation of 
infants and children from historical, anthropological, cultural, 
religious, social, psychological, medical, ethical, legal and
human 
rights perspectives. NOCIRC is a non-profit educational
organisation 
that provides information for parents and others about protecting
the 
rights of children.
<P>
<br>


<big><b>Symposium Description</b></big>
<p>
     Every year around the world, 13.3 million boys and 2 million
girls 
have part or all of their external sex organs cut off.
<P>
     These mutilations are rarely regarded as such in the
societies where 
they are performed.
<P>
     Even in developed nations, the proponents of male and female
sexual 
mutilation defend these mutilations with dubious scientific
studies and 
manipulated statistics and by appeals to custom and tradition.
<P>
     Doctors, parents, and politicians have been misled into
believing 
that these mutilations are beneficial, necessary, and harmless.
<P>
     Internationally respected experts in the fields of medicine,
science, 
politics, law, ethics, sociology, anthropology, history, and
religion 
will present the latest research, documentation, and analysis of
this 
world-wide problem.
<P>
<br>

<big><b>Symposium Objectives</b></big>
<p>
Upon completion of the Symposium, participants will understand:
<p>
the ethical, political, and legal aspects of sexual mutilation;
<P>
the cost and other burdens to health care systems of medically 
contraindicated sexual mutilations such as male circumcision;
<P>
the latest medical research on circumcision;
<P>
the latest medical research on phimosis;
<P>
the anatomical and functional consequences of male and female
sexual 
mutilation;
<P>
the religious and cultural aspects of sexual mutilation;
<P>
the need for religious, cultural, and gender sensitivity to the
issue 
of sexual mutilation;
<P>
the world-wide campaign to end sexual mutilation;
<P>
the psychological aspects and sequaelae of sexual mutilation;
<P>
