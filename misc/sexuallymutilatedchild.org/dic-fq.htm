[I have numbered eight points I would like to clarify and have added 
comments at the end.]

<P>"Deeper Into Circumcision: An Invitation to
Awareness" is a fascinating example of the passion of
the anti-circumcision/anti-genital mutilation movement.
Author John A. Erickson's self-described "work in
progress" is, above all, an impressive collage of
resources, observations, testimonials, anecdotes and
reference materials which collectively suggest a
growing, arguably radical movement to virtually
eliminate the practice of infant circumcision.

<P>At first glance the manual -- an 8&#189;-inch by
11-inch spiral-bound presentation -- resembles little
more than a mad journey through the hearts, minds
and, one might assume, exposed glans of a group of
skinless souls bent on justice against those who
robbed them of their "birthright." [1] (This "birthright,"
according to Erickson's studies, consists of a "piece of
skin almost equivalent to a 3-inch by 5-inch index card 
..." which contains "... about 50 million cells, 250
feet of nerves, 750 nerve endings, and 50 feet of
blood vessels.")

<P>But there is more here than a vehement, rebel-rousing fist 
in the air.

<P>The manual reveals a deep cynicism toward
the medical community at large, painting an
unflattering portrait of an industry littered with
ignorant physicians ("None of us do it for medical
reasons. We do it because we fear being cast out of
the tribe."), spineless nurses ("Hands ... shielded my
ears from his screams ..."), and more than a handful
of fetish-friendly folks whose Hippocratic oath includes
an allowance for explorations of any number of
sexually sadistic "on-the-job" fantasies ("... a bunch
of men nursing erections as they watched a shrieking
baby having his foreskin cut away ..."). The book
even documents dissension within the medical
community: One nurse -- a member of the
Conscientious Objectors to Circumcision Nurses at St.
Vincent's Hospital in Santa Fe, New Mexico, declares,
"Nurses of America, I did not become a nurse to hurt
babies, and neither did you. ... Wipe the blood from
your hands and join me!"

<P>Erickson's work also lists hundreds of
resources for foreskin enthusiasts and anti-circumcision
activists. An index of foreskin-related books, magazines
and video transcripts from popular talk shows such as
Donahue and Maury Povitch is included, as well as
foreskin/circumcision-related information excerpted
from other popular media. These accounts can be quite
telling. For example, a brief but seemingly verbatim
transcript from shock-talk host Rush Limbaugh's show
includes references to audience laughter throughout the
commentator's banter, illustrating the ignorant banter
between Limbaugh and his fans.

<P>Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this
chronicle is the sheer volume of information Erickson
has collected and assembled. Pandora's box has been
opened. Numerous first-person accounts of circumcision
trauma as well as recollections by parents, physicians
and nurses are chronicled with dramatic attention to
detail. One Jewish woman who refused to circumcise
her child tells her parents, "I would do anything not to
hurt you, my parents, except hurt my child." Clubs,
organizations, publications, Web sites and support
services combine to make a veritable cornucopia of
information for victims, supporters, foreskin lovers and
human-rights activists who have chosen circumcision
(or "genital mutilation") as their "cause du jour."

<P>According to Erickson's tome, most boys are
circumcised because parents feel compelled to comply
with social customs or religious beliefs. [2] In some
cases, physicians assume responsibility for a child and
circumcise without parental consent. Details of
lawsuits resulting from unauthorized circumcisions are
included in the book. All of this leads to Erickson's
fundamental point: Circumcision is a social and
religious practice with absolutely no medical basis. [3]
Testimonials from medical professionals, including
several physicians, substantiate this claim:
"Circumcision is a brutal ritual rooted in superstition
and should be abandoned," one doctor states. "There
is no medical reason for exposing the tip of the penis,"
says physician Robert Van Howe. "The penis functions
perfectly well with the tip unexposed." Other doctors
confirm that the foreskin heightens pleasure by
stimulating the glans with a natural sheath and
lubricant. Additionally, it serves as a shield for the
sensitive glans, providing a protective barrier against
clothing.

<P>Erickson argues that a boy must be left
intact until he reaches an age where he can make a
rational, educated choice about his own body. [4] This
way, circumcision becomes an issue of personal
choice, rather than a barbaric, undemocratic mandate
randomly imposed upon boys. In this regard, Erickson
seems grounded both in terms of logic and humanity.

<P>The author is a bit misguided, however, in his
efforts to portray circumcised penises as inherently
handicapped. [5] Granted, there are individuals who
have had, shall we say, less-than-attractive clip jobs.
And, there are many men who have experienced
medical difficulties after the procedure -- some with
long-lasting effects. As with any surgical effort, this
possibility exists. But to suggest that all men
circumcised as infants will experience sexual
dysfunction is a biased and illogical generalization.
Many men live very fulfilling lives without a foreskin.
[6] Yet Erickson's work suggests that circumcised men
experience pleasure on a lower level [7] -- since they
never had a foreskin, they simply "don't know any
better."

<P>Erickson's extremely thorough approach, at
times, serves to contradict his viewpoint while
unintentionally revealing an almost fanatical, seemingly
anarchic fringe of the anti-circumcision movement.
Erickson includes an excerpt from American Medical
News about a physician sentenced to a year's
probation for masturbating during a rectal exam. [8]
Since this article has nothing to do with circumcision,
its inclusion in the book is an obvious ploy to reinforce
the "crooked physician" philosophy to which many
activists give credence.

<P>Despite its shortcomings, Deeper Into
Circumcision is a fascinating read. Amid the chaos of
the more radical aspects of the anti-circumcision
movement, the author presents a bounty of information
in a well-organized style. I couldn't put Deeper Into
Circumcision down, and I highly recommend it to
anyone interested in foreskin, the intact male, the
process of restoration or the right to govern one's
body.

Comments by John Erickson:

<P>[1] Deeper Into Circumcision documents the thoughts,
feelings, and experiences of a wide variety men,
women, and children, both intact and not.

<P>[2] I have never said that most boys are circumcised
because parents feel compelled to comply with social
customs or religious beliefs. I think "social customs"
and "religious beliefs" are just masks to hide the real
reasons. I think the real reasons most boys are
circumcised are: 
<ul>
     (1) to affirm the "normalcy" of the
     father's and/or circumciser's circumcised
     partial penis; 
<P>
     (2) to free some circumcised males
     of what they see as a "homosexual"
     interest in foreskins, by destroying the part
     of intact males that they themselves lack and
     are therefore naturally curious about; 
<P>
     (3) because the circumciser is driven
     by a psychosexual compulsion to circumcise;
     and 
<P>
    (4) to avoid the humiliation and
     repercussions of acknowledging that no one
     should ever have been circumcised in the first
     place.</ul>

<P>[3] I have never said that circumcision is a social and
religious practice. My fundamental point is that infant
circumcision is foreskin amputation by force and
should therefore be outlawed.

<P>[4] I have never argued that a boy must be left intact
until he reaches an age where he can make a rational,
educated choice about his own body. I regard that
argument as a false issue because it suggests --
incorrectly, I think -- that, given the choice, a
substantial number of males would eventually choose
to have themselves circumcised. I don't know the
exact figures, but I would guess that the number of
males worldwide who choose to have their foreskins
cut off is less than one in a hundred, and I would
further guess that it's probably less than even one in
a thousand. 

<P>[5] I would suggest that anyone who doubts that a
circumcised penis is inherently handicapped watch a
circumcised male and an intact male masturbate.

<P>[6] Yes, many men live very fulfilling lives without a
foreskin. Many people live very fulfilling lives without
their sight. The point is that they shouldn't have to
and no one has the right to force them to. 

<P>[7] Circumcised men experience pleasure on a lower
level, yes, but also within a much narrower range at
that level. There is a whole universe of sensations
that a male without a foreskin does not and can not 
experience on any level at all. 

<P>[8] I included the article about the physician
masturbating during a rectal examination because it
documents that some doctors become doctors to get a
steady supply of unwitting sex partners with whom
and upon whom they can act out their sexual
compulsions. I didn't include an article about a doctor
masturbating while "examining" or cutting off a baby's
or child's or adult's foreskin because, as far as I
know, no such article has yet been printed. I'm
confident, however, that it's just a matter of time
before one is printed.
