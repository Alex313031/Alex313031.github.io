The Human Foreskin, Infant Circumcision and Common Sense</h2>

"A piece of skin the size of a quarter contains more
<BR>than three million cells, 12 feet of nerves, 100 sweat
<BR>glands, 50 nerve endings, and three feet of blood vessels."

<P>
      I would like to ask the American Medical Association a
question -- and I would appreciate a direct, complete
answer.
<P>
      Keeping in mind...
<UL><UL>
      that the human foreskin is a specialized organ of
touch;
<P>
      that regardless what they might indicate in casual
conversation, most men who have had the experience of having
a foreskin -- and many men who haven't -- regard foreskin
amputation (circumcision), even when justified medically, as
a crippling, disfiguring mutilation;
<P>
      that the only reason most males in the United States
today lack the foreskin most males in the rest of the world
take for granted is that their foreskins were cut off when
they were babies, when they couldn't protect themselves from
the circumcisers who circumcised them -- in other words,
because their foreskins were cut off by force;
<P>
      that cutting off a baby's foreskin affords him no
proven benefits, but severs him from a means of perceiving,
experiencing and enjoying his existence, and subjects him to
many known physical and psychological risks, including death
-- and including the certainty, assuming he lives, of going
through life with as much as half or more of the natural
surface of his penis missing;
<P>
      that regardless how harmless or even beneficial such
an act might seem to the person who commits it, cutting
healthy, sensitive, normally functioning tissue -- living
flesh -- an organ of perception -- from someone else's body
without his consent, is partial murder;
<P>
      that consent given by a person of good will to commit
such an act against a baby can never be -- and never has
been -- informed;
<P>
      that the only informed choice possible for a person of
good will to make about the foreskin of a baby is the choice
that the baby himself, when old enough to understand what
his foreskin is and what would have been done to it if he
had been circumcised, is most likely to be glad was made for
him;
<P>
      that that choice, beyond any reasonable doubt, is to
leave his foreskin intact;
<P>
      and keeping in mind that three out of four male babies
in this country -- more than a million a year -- begin life
by having their foreskins cut off, please tell me:
</UL></UL>
      What would it take to impel the American Medical
Association to issue a statement to the effect that the
position of the American Medical Association regarding the
foreskins of babies is, not just that "circumcision is
unnecessary," but that the birthright of male babies to keep
all of the penis they are born with should be secured by
law?
<P>
      Such a statement -- and such a law -- are long
overdue.

[I sent a copy of the letter above to Thomas S. Szasz, MD,
Professor of Psychiatry at State University of New York,
Syracuse, author of many books, including <B>The
Manufacture of Madness</B> and <B>The Myth of Mental Illness</B>,
and keynote speaker at the Third International Symposium
on Circumcision (University of Maryland, 1994). 
A few days later I received the following letter from Dr. Szasz,
quoted here with his permission:
<UL><UL>
      "Many thanks for sending me a copy of your excellent
open letter to the AMA. I agree, of course."
</UL></UL>
I never received a reply from the American Medical
Association.]
