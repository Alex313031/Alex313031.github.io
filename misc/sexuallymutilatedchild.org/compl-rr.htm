"The risks are many and can be devastating."</B></center>
<P>
<BR>
1. <B>Meatal Ulceration</B> -- "ammoniacal urine burns on
the unprotected glans ... Possibly over half of all
circumcised infants develop this." (p. 200) 
<P> 
2. <B>Meatal Stricture</B> -- "results from prolonged or
repeated episodes of meatal ulceration. The repeatedly
irritated meatus becomes narrowed ... pain and
difficulty with urination ... can result in infections
and kidney problems." (p. 204) 
<P> 
3. <B>Hemorrhage</B> -- "excessive bleeding ... a fairly
common complication of circumcision." (p. 206) 
<P> 
4. <B>Retention of Plastic Bell Ring</B> -- "the ring fails to
fall off and instead becomes buried under the skin
along the shaft of the penis [and has to be surgically
removed] ... leaves ... a permanent ridge or groove
along the shaft of the penis." (p. 210) 
<P> 
5. <B>Concealed Penis</B> -- "the penile shaft, following
circumcision, retreats into the surrounding skin and
fatty area and cannot be seen." [Must be corrected
surgically.] (p. 211) 
<P> 
6. <B>Urethral Fistula</B> -- "a hole going from the side of
the male urethra to the outside of the
penis ... results either from accidental crushing of
the urethra by the circumcision clamp, an abnormality
in the urethra, or from a stitch placed in the underside
of the penis to control excessive bleeding at the site
of the frenulum." (p. 214) 
<P> 
7. <B>Phimosis of Remaining Foreskin</B> -- "occasionally
the remaining piece of foreskin becomes tightly
attached to the sides of the glans." (p. 215) 
<P> 
8. <B>Urinary Retention</B> -- "Occasionally a baby will not
urinate for several hours following circumcision.
Sometimes the cause is an overly tight bandage
wrapped around the wound. In other instances the
cause is less clear." (p. 217) 
<P> 
9. <B>Glans Necrosis</B> -- "the death of body tissue ... 
has happened to the glans following circumcision due
to an overly tight bandage or a Plasti-bell ring that is
too small." (p. 218) 
<P> 
10. <B>Injury and Loss of Glans</B> -- "Occasionally the
glans can be injured or entirely cut off during circum-
cision ... Usually a permanent deformity results." (p.
219) 
<P>
11. <B>Excessive Skin Loss</B> -- "devastating complications
result from cutting off too much skin ... Excessive
skin loss can result from the operator severing too
much foreskin, from infection of the wound resulting in
tissue death, or from a burn caused by an
electrocautery device. Sometimes the entire penile
shaft becomes denuded and skin grafting is
necessary ... as the individual grows older his penile
skin becomes too tight, causing discomfort on
erection." (p. 219) 
<P> 
12. <B>Skin Bridge</B> -- "a complication in healing of the
[circumcision] wound, by which a piece of skin from
the shaft of the penis has become attached to the
glans, or another point along the shaft, forming a
bridge  that must be surgically corrected." (p. 221) 
<P> 
13. <B>Vomiting, Apneic Spells</B> -- "cessation of
breathing, usually for a short period of time ... can
be life-threatening." [Baby cries from pain. Mother
nurses baby. Baby vomits and inhales vomit.] (p. 222) 
<P>
14. <B>Sewing of Penile Skin to Glans</B> -- "Sewing the
skin edge to the glans, with consequent burying of the
corona. " (p. 223) 
<P>
15. <B>Laceration of Penile or Scrotal Skin</B> -- "Accidental 
laceration of the penile skin and scrotum
following circumcision has been seen." (p. 223) 
<P> 
16. <B>Undetected Hypospadias</B> -- "a congenital
deformity in which a fistula naturally occurs in the
underside of the penis ... corrected by plastic
surgery. The foreskin provides an easily available piece
of tissue for use in skin grafting ... If an infant with
hypospadias is ... circumcised, this potentially useful
piece of skin has been destroyed and the operator
must resort to more complicated types of skin grafts
to reconstruct the penis." (p. 223) 
<P> 
17. <B>Preputial Cysts</B> -- "an abnormal, closed pocket of
body tissue which contains fluid or solid material.
Occasionally cysts develop along the remaining edges
of foreskin at the site where the skin was severed."
(p. 223) 
<P> 
18. <B>Complications of Anesthesia</B> -- "Complications
can ensue from use of any type of anesthesia for any
medical procedure, including circumcision." (p. 224) 
<P> 
19. <B>Tuberculosis and other Diseases from Mezizah</B> -- "Mezizah 
[rarely done today] is the third step of the
Jewish ritual circumcision ceremony, in which the
mohel applies his mouth to the fresh circumcision
wound. Diseases have been spread due to this
practice." (p. 225) 
<P> 
20. <B>Strangulation of the Glans by Hair</B> -- "long
strands of human hair wrapped around the coronal
sulcus." (p. 225) 
<P> 
21. <B>Recurrence of Pneumothorax</B> -- "a collection of
air or gas in the membranes that surround the lungs or
pleural cavity ... an infant developed a
pneumothorax as a result of mechanical assistance
with breathing for severe respiratory distress at
birth ... [then] the infant was circumcised. His
excessive crying from the pain of the operation caused
the pneumothorax to recur." (p. 225) 
<P> 
22. <B>Pulmonary Embolism</B> -- "a clot of blood which
travels through the circulatory system and becomes
lodged in one of the blood vessels in the lungs. This
causes severe breathing difficulties and can result in
death." (p. 226) 
<P> 
23. <B>Keloid Formation</B> -- "an abnormal development
consisting of a raised, firm, thickened, red piece of
scar tissue. Such a formation at the site of
circumcision creates a grotesque deformation of the
organ, with obstruction of its function." (p. 226) 
<P> 
24. <B>Lymphedema or Elephantiasis of Skin</B> -- "swelling 
or obstruction of the lymph vessels ... can
result from circumcision." (p. 226) 
<P>
25. <B>Reaction of Older Sibling</B> -- " her two-year-old
son had tried to amputate his [own] penis and was
bleeding profusely ... had witnessed his baby
brother's ritual circumcision." (p. 227) 
<P> 
26. <B>Cosmetic Problems</B> -- "The Gomco clamp and
Plasti-bell devices ... if applied crookedly
can ... result in cosmetic problems. Older methods
such as smashing the skin with a hemostat and slicing
it off present greater risk that an uneven cut will
result." (p. 228) 
<P> 
27. <B>Loss of Penis</B> -- "There have been cases in which
the penis has been lost due to circumcision ... In
some cases enough penile shaft remained so that after
extensive operations a functional penis could be
reconstructed. In other cases the child has been
surgically made into a girl." (p. 228) 
<P> 
28. <B>Death</B> [Death as a result of circumcision is
discussed on pages viii, 68, 198, 207, 208, 209-210,
224 and 299.]
