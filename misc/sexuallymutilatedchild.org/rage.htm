<b><big>rage</big></b>
           
<P>there's a special place in hell for the man that I loathe,
<br>the man that I want to torture.
            
<P>I want to strap him down on a bed of razors,
<br>I want to peel the skin from his body, piece by piece,
<br>then pour sulphuric acid on the exposed flesh
<br>and watch him scream.
<br>I want to place his penis in a vice
<br>place his testicles in two others,
<br>then slowly, slowly, slowly tighten
<br>tighten them until his balls explode
<br>I want him impaled upon a stake
<br>exposed for all to see
<br>drive the stake into the ground
<br>out in the country, where the birds can come
<br>and pick the flesh from his still-twisting body

<P>I'd gladly spend 100 years in prison
<br>if I could see my rage come true

<P>--Brian E. Pederson
