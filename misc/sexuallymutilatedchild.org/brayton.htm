It is a great relief to talk about my circumcision. No other
event in my life has affected me as strongly as this mutilation
done to my body when I was just a few days old. And there is no
other event about which I am nearly as angry, sad, and depressed.
Even so, this is the first time I have sat down and tried to
recount the ways circumcision has affected my life -- physically,
mentally, psychologically, emotionally, spiritually.

<P>I was born in 1960. Although my circumcision was not what
most doctors would call "botched" (all circumcisions are botched by 
definition, in my opinion,
because they destroy healthy, functional tissue), my circumcision was 
tight and extensive. My entire frenulum was removed.

<P>Like most other circumcised males, I do not remember my
circumcision consciously. In August 1994, however, I attended a
workshop using specialized breathing techniques to access intense
repressed emotional states. I remembered and relived the
experience of being circumcised (with less intensity, however,
than I must have felt as an baby).

<P>Most of what I learned about human sexuality during my early
adolescence came from a few well-written books, such as Wardell
Pomeroy's <I>Boys and Sex</I>. My family was quite repressed sexually. I
don't remember their ever being physically affectionate beyond
goodnight kisses, nor were they very affectionate with my younger
brother and me. Their only attempt to discuss sex with me was
rather pathetic. When I was seventeen and already had a
girlfriend, my father came into my room and made a painfully
awkward attempt to discuss sex with me. I felt sorry and
embarrassed for him. I'm sad that my parents gave me no real
support or guidance as I entered into the mysterious world of
adult sexuality.

<P>As a child, I vaguely remember hearing about circumcision
from time to time. I grew up in suburban Southern California,
where almost all the boys I knew were circumcised too. Like many
other boys of my era, I assumed I had <I>not</I> been circumcised. My
penis looked like everyone else's and I assumed I had all of the
penis I was born with. I remember feeling glad that this strange,
horrible thing had not been done to me.

<P>As I grew into a young adult, however, I became aware of
information that made me think that maybe I was in fact
circumcised. I don't remember the exact sequence of events, but I
think it was around 1985, when I was 25, that I realized for sure
that my penis had been surgically cut.

<P>I spent several years in denial about this and the pain and
loss it represented. I tried many rationalizations, which were
easier than accepting that I had lost so important a part of my
identity and self. In 1987, I began attending men's events that
focused on support and personal growth. Some included workshops
on circumcision. In 1989, I began to acknowledge to myself more
consciously my anger and unhappiness that someone had cut part of
my penis off when I was a baby.

<P>The following summer, I attended a support meeting organized
by the National Organization of Restoring Men (NORM) (then known
as RECAP), founded to offer emotional support to men involved in
non-surgical foreskin restoration. Restoration entails gradually
stretching the remaining penile skin to re-cover the glans. Since
that meeting, I have attempted foreskin restoration several
times. NORM founder Wayne Griffiths generously and kindly kept in
touch with me for several years after I returned to Boston, where
I was then living. More recently, other restoring men have helped
me in my attempt to restore.

<P>I've had little success, however. I find using the various
devices to stretch my remaining skin very draining emotionally
because it reminds me of what I have lost. I also had problems
with urination and soreness from taping, etc. Because my
circumcision is relatively tight, I have to do more to achieve a
given degree of restoration than men whose circumcisers left them
more skin. My longest period of attempting restoration was two to
three months in 1994. I'm not restoring right now. I want to, but
I'm not sure when I will have the determination and resolve
necessary to see this emotionally and physically demanding, drawn
out process through to its successful end.

<P>I talked with my mother about circumcision for the first time
in December 1992. A month later we talked about it again. Both
times, I was terrified to mention the subject to her. I was sure
she would shame me or refuse to discuss it. However, my mother
has grown in many ways over the past thirty years, especially
since the death of my father in 1990. She listened to what I had
to say and even acknowledged that she understood that I was in
pain and why I was in pain. Although she didn't say so, it was
clear that she regretted allowing me and my brother to be
circumcised. She told me she had given the matter almost no
thought at the time, as I had suspected. The doctor had advised
her that circumcision was "cleaner," and that was enough to
satisfy her and my father that I should be circumcised.

<P>In a third conversation with my mother, in October 1996, she
told me that my father was circumcised. This surprised me because
he was born in Nebraska in 1924, when circumcision in the U.S.
was still uncommon. The fact that he was circumcised surely
affected my parents' decision to have me circumcised too.

<P>The last time I saw my beloved grandfather alive, August
1995, I noticed that he wasn't circumcised. This didn't surprise
me because he was born in Oklahoma in 1904. But I felt sad that
he was whole and I wasn't.

<P>Since I first discussed circumcision with my mother, I have
frequently alluded to my anti-circumcision activism when I talk
or write to her. I don't go out of my way to mention the subject
but I do let her know what I'm doing when it fits into the flow
of the conversation or my letter. I still usually feel somewhat
awkward and nervous about mentioning circumcision to her, but I
continue to share my thoughts and feelings about this with her.

<P>I often wonder if being aware of the damage I have suffered
hasn't made me enjoy life less. I wonder if I wouldn't have been
much happier if I had remained unaware of what I have lost. This,
of course, is like asking what it would be like to be a fish.
It's futile. I did in fact come to understand that my
circumcision had removed a significant, irreplaceable component
of sexual pleasure possible only with a foreskin and rendered me
incapable of ever experiencing it.

<P>This loss is what upsets me most. I can deal with the
appearance of my circumcised penis. But knowing that I never have
experienced and never will experience the full range of sexual
sensations and pleasures intact males enjoy and take for granted
is very hard for me to accept and deal with.

<P>My own sexual history has contributed to my turmoil about all
this. I was 26 before I developed enough self-confidence and
worked through the sexuality issues I had from my childhood
enough to begin enjoying a fairly normal, healthy sex life. So my
grief at realizing I have been denied the the full range of
pleasurable sensations possible only with a foreskin and frenulum
is compounded by my loss of roughly a decade of sexual activity
and enjoyment.

<P>Before I learned that there were other men unhappy about
being circumcised who had started a movement to end routine
circumcision, I had already thought about circumcision as an
extreme form of rape. I would rather have been raped than
circumcised.

<P>I am reminded of my loss several times a day every day of my
life. It's a kind of torture, from which I can never escape. I
can never get it out of my mind. Every time I urinate, every time
I have an erection, every time I dress or undress or take a
shower or walk down the street, I am reminded that part of my
penis is missing. Every time my naked glans touches my clothing,
I am reminded that I have no foreskin. Bicycling is especially
troublesome because my glans touches my pants almost every time I
raise and lower my legs. When I was a child I wondered why the
head of my penis was the first place I felt pain when it was
cold.

<P>Like many other circumcised males, I rediscover the horror of
circumcision firsthand every day. I have noticed a dramatic,
heartbreaking loss of sexual sensitivity during the last couple
of years. This is caused, of course, by the continuous build-up
of layers of keratin over the mucous membrane tissue that remains
on the penis after the foreskin is removed.

<P>Because my ongoing experience with circumcision affects my
life so strongly, it has fueled my commitment to the struggle for
men's rights and male equality in our society. My circumcision
constantly reminds me that I am not crazy in thinking that our
society oppresses males as well as females. This is not yet the
conventional awareness and may not be for a long time. But
circumcision reminds me that many of our ideas come from cultural
prejudices and blindnesses, and reaffirms for me the importance
of thinking for oneself and not just blindly trusting and
accepting preconceived notions.

<P>It hurts and angers me deeply that our society shows so much
compassion for women and children yet so little for the concerns
and struggles of men. The signs of this are all around us: the
passage of the Violence Against Women Act in a society where
three-fourths of all victims of violence are male. Almost as many
males as females are the victims of domestic violence, but much
more help and support are available to females. Men around the
world are systematically forced to sacrifice their bodies and
lives in war. We are also forced to give our bodies and lives in
the workplace; 94% of all Americans who die at work are male.

<P>I have come to believe that the numbness in our circumcised
penises parallels and even contributes to our emotional numbness
that those in power, and society in general, regard as necessary
in order for us to fulfill our roles as producers.

<P>I would give everything I own to have my foreskin
back, to know how I was meant to be, to have my body whole and natural. I
would give up my music collection, probably my single most valued
possession, and everything else I own, including my house and life savings.

<P>Circumcision without the consent of the circumcised,
regardless of the parents' wishes or religious beliefs, should
definitely be outlawed.

<P>I feel much more anger toward my circumciser than toward my
parents. Considering when and where I was born, my parents would
have had to have been unusually questioning people to have saved
me from the knife. Actually, they were quite typical for that
time and place and would never have acted against a doctor's
advice. Given the kind of people they were, I had no hope of
remaining intact.

<P>I feel some anger toward them for not questioning this
terrible violation of their firstborn's physical integrity, but I
feel much more anger toward the doctor, who should have known,
and perhaps did know better. It is criminal that he advised
thousands of parents to have the genitals of their newborn,
perfect baby boys cut.

<P>I definitely think that my circumciser should have been
stopped by force. I wouldn't go so far as to say that he and
others who cut off healthy foreskins should receive the death
penalty. I do think, however, that life imprisonment would be
morally justified, because he significantly harmed thousands of
lives.

<P>Many babies have died as a result of circumcision, and many
others have lost their entire penis and then been cut even more
to turn them into "girls." This strikes me as absolutely
outrageous.

<P>Another unfortunate effect of my circumcision is the anger I
feel toward society for its refusal to recognize male pain and
male suffering. These feelings have affected my friendships and
romantic relationships and have made it difficult at times for me
to sustain certain connections. When a potential friend or lover
can't or won't recognize or acknowledge the horrors of
circumcision and/or the other forms of oppression and pain most
males in our society are forced to endure, I can become quite
emotional, sometimes at the expense of the relationship. Once I
became fully aware of how circumcision has harmed me, this was
almost inevitable. It's another way circumcised has harmed me
indirectly.

<P>Recently I talked about circumcision with a Jewish friend who
is the mother of a boy who, like most other Jewish boys, is
circumcised. Her open-mindedness, for which I was grateful,
surprised me. I know that because of my own turbulent feelings
about this issue, I did not present my point of view as calmly
and effectively as I might have.

<P>I feel extremely frustrated that in 1998, in a developed country, 
we have to spend time and
energy even discussing this. Do we discuss why babies' arms and legs should
not be cut off? Do we weigh the medical advantages and disadvantages of
amputating women's breasts? It is only because of our peculiar cultural
history of practicing circumcision for the last century that this horrible
mutilation is even an issue. In a truly civilized society such discussions
would never even arise.
