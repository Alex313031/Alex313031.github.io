<P>CIRCUMCISION: THE HIDDEN TRAUMA is the first intensive exploration of the unrecognized psychological and social
aspects of this increasingly controversial American cultural practice. The books has been endorsed by professionals in
psychology, psychiatry, child development, pediatrics, obstetrics, childbirth education, sociology, and anthropology.

<P>Without much knowledge, the American public generally assumes that our cultural practice of circumcision is a trivial
and benign procedure. As discussed in CIRCUMCISION: THE HIDDEN TRAUMA, plain facts and recent research results
conflict with these beliefs and raise questions. Dr. Goldman's application of psychological and social research
coherently explains both the tenacity of the practice and the contradictory information and beliefs about it.

<P>After a review of the surprising abilities of infants and their responses to circumcision pain, the long-term psychological
effects of circumcision are examined from the perspectives of both traditional and more recent, innovative psychological
theories. We learn that circumcision has potential effects not only on men and sexuality, but also on mother-child
relationships, male-female relationships, and societal traits and problems. The text is supported with clinical reports,
interviews, surveys, and thorough documentation.

<P>CIRCUMCISION: THE HIDDEN TRAUMA identified an overlooked source of early pain and simultaneously points us in
the direction of both healing and preventing the pain. It is of particular interest to men who seek to explore their
sexuality and deepen self-awareness; women who want to understand men better; parents and children's advocates;
childbirth educators and allied workers; and mental health, medical, and academic professionals. The book has wide
appeal because, more generally, it is about trusting our instincts, questioning some of our cultural values and
assumptions, and reflecting on who we are and who we can be as individuals and as a society.
