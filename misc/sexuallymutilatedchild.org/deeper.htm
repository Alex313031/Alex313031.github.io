"Pandora's box has been opened ... a fascinating read ...
<br>I couldn't put <I>Deeper Into Circumcision</I> down, and I
highly 
<br>recommend it to anyone interested in foreskin, the intact
male, 
<br>the process of restoration or the right to govern one's
body."

<h3>D: CIRCUMCISION: WHAT YOUR BABY CAN'T TELL YOU</h3>
</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<center>
"But deception is often nonverbal, and conveyed instead 
<br>by gesture or false visual clues; even by silence, as 
<br>in situations where a clear risk ought to be pointed out."

<P><I>Encyclopedia of Bioethics</I>
<P>The Free Press, 1978
</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>

"There is nothing more tragic in life than the 
<br>utter impossibility of changing what you have done."

<P>John Galsworthy

<blockquote>
Consent given by a person of good will to circumcise a baby can
never be -- and never has been -- informed. The only informed
choice possible for a person of good will to make about the
foreskin of
a baby is the choice that the baby himself, when old enough to
understand what his foreskin is and what would have been done to
it he 
had been circumcised, is most likely to be glad was made for him.
That
choice, beyond any reasonable doubt, is to let him keep his
foreskin
intact.
