<h2>Let's Let Everyone 
<br>Keep Their Genitals Intact 
<br>For a Happier World</h2></center>
<P>
<br>

People fall, roughly, into one of four groups: 
<ul><ul>
     1) Genitals intact and glad 
<br>     2) Genitals intact and sorry 
<br>     3) Genitals mutilated and glad 
<br>     4) Genitals mutilated and sorry 
</ul></ul>
Consider each group. 
<ul><ul>
     Group 1: Genitals intact and glad. No problem. (About
     80 percent of the men and 95 percent of the women in the
     world are in this group -- and want to stay in it.) 
<P>
     Group 2: Genitals intact and sorry. No problem -- they
     can have their genitals mutilated. (This group is very small
     because the vast majority of people who are given the choice
     prefer to keep their genitals intact.)
<P>
     Group 3: Genitals mutilated and glad. No problem. (How
     many, however, would have been glad their genitals were intact 
     if they had been given the choice?) 
<P>
     Group 4: Genitals mutilated and sorry. <b><I>Problem</I></B>. (How
     many men and women with mutilated genitals would rather 
     their genitals were intact? If only one percent of the males in the
     U.S. whose genitals were mutilated in infancy by circumcision
     would rather be intact -- surely a low estimate -- that would
     be about a million males.) 
</ul></ul>
There seems to be no real solution to the problem of men and women with 
mutilated genitals who would rather their genitals had not been mutilated. 
But there <I>is</I> a solution to the problem in general:    
<ul><ul>
     <I>Let everyone keep all of the genitals they are born with</I>.
</ul></ul>
Imagine that infant and child genital mutilation and all other forms of 
forced and coerced genital mutilation have been abolished. Look at the 
picture now. 
<P>
People still fall into the same four groups -- but with a happy 
difference. 
<ul><ul>
     Group 1: Intact and glad. Still no problem. (More than
     99 percent of the people in the world are now in this group.
     Now virtually everyone has intact genitals and is glad.)
<P> 
     Group 2: Intact and sorry. Still no problem -- they can
     still be mutilated. (This group is now even smaller than it
     was before because now almost no one has any reason to want
     their genitals mutilated -- or to want anyone else's
     genitals mutilated.) 
<P>
     Group 3: Mutilated and glad. Still no problem. (This
     group is now virtually non-existent because genital
     mutilation itself is now virtually non-existent.) 
<P>
     Group 4: Mutilated and sorry. <B><I>Virtually no problem</I></B>. 
     This problem has been almost totally eliminated because its 
     cause -- genital mutilation without consent of the
     mutilated -- has now been eliminated. Now almost no one is
     mutilated and sorry because now almost no one is mutilated.
     The only people in this group now are the very few who were
     intact and sorry, had their genitals mutilated, and are now
     mutilated and sorry. 
</ul></ul>
Now as few people as possible are mutilated and sorry, and
as many people as possible are intact and glad. 
<P> 
Let's do everything we can, therefore, to abolish infant and
child genital mutilation and all other forms of forced and
coerced genital mutilation -- male <I>and</I> female -- once and for
all, in this country and throughout the world, and honor the
birthright of all human beings everywhere to keep their genitals 
intact, for a happier world.
