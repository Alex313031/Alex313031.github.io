<b>From a conversation with a midwife who circumcises babies:</b>

<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      "If there were anything about circumcision that would
make you stop circumcising babies, would you want to be
aware of it?"
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      "No."
<P>
<br>

<b>From a conversation with Marilyn Milos, RN, founder and
Executive Director of the National Organization of
Circumcision Information Resource Centers:</b>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      "Was that too heavy? Would you 
rather I hadn't told
you that? Are there some aspects of the circumcision issue
you'd rather not be aware of?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      "No -- I want to be aware of 
everything."

A Suggestion for Settling the Infant 
<br>Circumcision Dispute Once and for All</h2></center>

<br>

<b>To the American Academy of Pediatrics (4/18/88):</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I read in a recent newsletter of the 
National
Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers
that the American Academy of Pediatrics is reconsidering its
position on infant circumcision.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  There is a way to determine -- 
quickly, easily and
with great certainty -- exactly what the Academy's position
on that amputation should be.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ask your friends and colleagues 
whose foreskins are
intact how they feel about that fact -- and why -- and how
they feel about the idea of having -- or of ever having had
-- their foreskins cut off -- to "protect" them from AIDS,
urinary tract infections or anything else -- and the only
position possible for an organization whose members
subscribe to the "Do no harm" ethic to have about the
foreskin of a baby -- or anyone else -- should become
perfectly clear.
