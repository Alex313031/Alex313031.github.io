<P>Dear Dr. Lannon,

<P>The March 1, 1999 AAP position statement about
circumcision lists the 
prevention of 
urinary tract infections as a potential medical "benefit" of 
circumcision. As 
you well know, the standard of care for urinary tract infections is 
antibiotics, not amputation.

<P>Furthermore, the UTI "studies" the AAP Task Force reviewed were 
done on the 
wrong control group. The controls included intact infants who were damaged 
during the newborn exam when the physician willfully ripped their 
undeveloped 
foreskins from their undeveloped glans. The iatrogenic sub-foreskin space 
and the surrounding raw glans and raw inner foreskin were an open 
invitation 
to infection from fecal pathogens. Parents of the intact infants were 
usually instructed to forcefully retract the foreskin during diaper 
changes 
and bathing. Continually breaking the reforming adhesions created 
open sores 
into which diaper pathogens were able to enter.

<P>It would have been more enlightening and honest 
had the Task Force reviewed 
the UTI rate of intact undamaged infants from a country that neither 
circumcises nor tolerates the painful ripping of the foreskin away from the 
newborn's glans. Physicians contributed to the very infections they claim 
circumcision prevents. Physicians and misinformed parents, not the intact 
adherent undamaged virgin foreskins, contributed to the 
infections.

<P>To prevent UTIs and other forms of infection, the AAP needs to actively 
promote breastfeeding, rooming in, and home births. 
To prevent UTIs, the AAP 
needs to prevent newborn and maternal pain so as to keep their immune 
systems
optimal, prevent forced retraction of the undeveloped foreskin, and prevent 
circumcision. The AAP needs to recommend instead
the circumcision of the 
circumcisers' medical licenses, as well as those of physicians who damage 
the 
infant's undeveloped penis by forcibly and prematurely retracting
his foreskin, 
and of nurses who "teach" parents to retract the foreskin of the infant's 
undeveloped penis.

<P>The UTI "studies" the AAP circumcision Task Farce cited for review are 
misleading and knowingly designed as a rationalization to promote 
circumcision. They are not evidence-based medicine. The "studies" are 
irrelevant because 
antibiotics, not amputation, are the standard of care for UTI.
Citing the misleading UTI "studies" in the AAP circumcision 
position statement to provide evidence of some potential medical "benefit" 
from circumcision is unethical; is a deceptive attempt to excuse, justify, 
and condone circumcision; puts present and future babies in jeopardy; is a 
serious medical-legal liability; and is a licensing and disciplinary issue 
of grave concern to the entire circumcision task force, to circumcisers who 
follow the AAP Task Force recommendations, and to insurance carriers who 
collude in making the unnecessary sexual surgery of circumcision an economic 
benefit to the circumcisers.

<P>Please correct the deficiencies in the AAP report and stop citing the 
fallacious UTI circumcision material as providing "some potential medical 
benefit."

<P>In disappointment,
