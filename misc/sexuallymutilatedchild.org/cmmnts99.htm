I am a visitor to your site "In Memory of the Sexually Mutilated
Child." I think this is a great site and service to the public.
However, I
find it quite distasteful that you imply 
[<a href="feelings.htm">"Feelings Too Violent to Describe"</a>] 
that circumcision leads to
homosexuality, as if being gay or bisexual is another bad thing.
Isn't
intactivism about respect for fellow human beings?? I am very
curious to
know why you may feel otherwise.

<P>I just visited your page. 
I saw only a few of the <a href="post1.htm">photos</a>. 
I am a mother and cannot look at them without crying. 
I have two boys, 2.5 years old and 2 months old. 
The thought never crossed our minds to do this horrible thing 
to our babies!
Your site is graphic but it needs to be shown to people 
who have these awful beliefs that this needs to be 
done for cleanliness, to stop masturbation, to look like dad or 
because God says so.
Our sons are beautiful, healthy, intact, and happy! 
Never would we have thought of putting them through unnecessary
pain of 
having part of their bodies cut off! 
I will have to revisit and read the written things.
I can't handle the photos. 
Thank you for this very potent site!

<P>Thank you for your web site. I am an American female who was 
never informed on exactly what circumcision is. My boyfriend is
not 
circumcised and I was still confused on the whole matter so I
wanted 
to find out more information. Your website helped me in doing so. 
Thank you.

<P>In your photos of babies during circumcision, the 
<a href="post4.htm">circumcised baby with his penis bandaged</a>
does not look unhappy. It looks like a normal baby, very young, 
who all have that "worried look" on their face.
A good sharp knife, according to all the men I've ever
talked to, including those who do the procedure themselves, 
does not hurt. Have you not ever nicked yourself with a razor
(straight), or an Exacto knife? If it is very sharp there will be
very little pain. Try it some day, you'll see.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many men like myself who have been
circumcised at an older age (i.e. 25) find circumcised sex just
as good, if not better, than before the procedure. I think you
should
show some of those men's testimonies. 
I would much rather have sex circumcised than uncircumcised, 
never mind the risk of infection, and all that yukky smegma that 
hovers around the uncircumcised man. Glad to be rid
of that. Yes, I read the part about smegma being like a skin
softener.
Use handcream, it does a great job.

<P>Your site (In Memory...) was one of the first I found on the
web, 
and I was astounded. Thanks for all your work and caring.

<P>I wonder if I have a law suit? After seeing your web site 
I am totally jealous. My mom had mine cut. She had to have been
mislead.

<P>I just visited your web site and found the information both
painful and
shocking. I was searching for sites about circumcision because I
have been
feeling horrible about having my son circumcised (he is now 4).
When he was
born, my wife insisted he be circumcised because her son (from a
previous marriage) "had" to be circumcised because of
complications
caused by a doctor pulling his foreskin back when he was very
young. I gave
in to her request but was horrified as I watched them
circumcise my son - but by then it was too late. This has
bothered
me for many years, and my wife will not talk to me about it. I am
angry 
at the doctors - I feel that I was NOT informed, and had someone
taken 
10 minutes to go over the options
and risks I would have stopped the mutilation of my son. I need
somewhere
to turn for support - I dream about my child's screams. I am
angry at
myself for not standing my ground, since even before I gave in I
viewed circumcision as unnecessary. I feel I was mislead and
rushed into a
decision I now regret. I would sue the bastards if I could - I
had a
right to know what the procedure involved BEFORE it was happening
in front
of me. I would appreciate any information (support groups, legal
action,
etc.) you can provide. My son is a wonderful, bright, loving
child and I
cannot believe what I allowed to happen to him. Thank you for
"listening."

<P>I looked through your web site and think it is wonderful. 
As a mother of 2, one a boy, I think it is a great
site for anyone thinking about having or pregnant with a child. 
I had my little boy Sept. 97 and we had thought about
circumcision, 
but when I saw how perfect and whole he was there was no way I
would do
that to him. Even my husband, who is cut, did not want to do it
to our son. 
The doctor said she would freeze him if we were worried about
pain 
but I said No, he was whole and perfect when he came out he will
stay 
that way till he dies. I also
told her I had no right to do that to him, he did not give me his
consent. She thought I was a little weird as she does this often 
to little boys. If it illegal to do it to girls and women, 
WHY IS NOT ILLEGAL TO DO IT TO INNOCENT LITTLE PERFECT BOYS????
I know I would not want my
clitoris cut off especially without freezing. 
I am 27 and even if I had 10 boys there is no way someone could 
pay me to do that to my sons. I have also noticed with friends
who 
had boys the boys who were done were crankier, more temperamental
and 
more unpleasant
as opposed to the boys who were not.  
My son is happy, fun, very loving, and is going to grow old
knowing 
I didn't hurt him just for being born. Again, thank you for a 
wonderful Web Site.

<P>Well, I can see your [sic] an anti Circ. Clown.
All I can say is that NO self respecting male would go through
life uncut.
Circ. is a status symble [sic] in the US, and uncuts are
considered the 
lowest end of the scale. If your [sic] not cut you ain't shit.

<P>I agree with everything you say.
I was very surprised to learn so many people in North
America circumcise their sons. The culture and people here in 
Israel are not so liberal as in the U.S. We feel we're in 
a war when our sons are born.

<P>Your statements [<a href="iccah.htm">
Infant Circumcision: Crime Against Humanity</a>]
are eloquent. The amazing thing to me is that they are
actually statements of the obvious, or what should be obvious! 
It doesn't require any particular background or political
philosophy 
or religious orientation or agenda. It simply requires the
exercising of what is apparently
the least common of all senses in this country, COMMON SENSE! 
Anyone in favor of circumcision can arrive at their position 
by only two means: ignorance or cruelty. Most are ignorant and we 
must continue to strive to educate them, especially doctors. 
Thanks for your efforts in that direction.

<P>I just went through your pictures, you are 100% right, anyone
who doers
that to the children is a barbaric and a criminal, and should not
be allowed
to do that. I am very sorry for the lost of that child. very very
sorry. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I am again inviting you to one of my performance, you will be
surprised.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I was right by telling you that my ancestor did the right
thing. It is a
gruesome pictures and acts that should not be forgiven, you and
me and
everyone with a little brain in their heads should rise up
against this kind
of performance that is in your pictures. it is awful. That is not
what my
G-od has comanded [sic]. good luck to you. I promise you If g-od
forbid
one
of the babies or the adults had the same results, I will stop
doing it. that
is why I do not carry a malpractice insurance. Thank G-od I do
only the best job possible.
<br>[From a mohel]

<P>Your site really helped me get going in this movement again. 
You inspired me. I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.

<P>This is a dangerously powerful web site, chock full of
incredible information about circumcision.
This whole situation regarding involuntary neonatal
circumcision is getting very, very dangerous, because after
inspecting this web site and performing the necessary
research, many people may become so sick, so ill, so
insulted, so offended, so angry, that some of them may begin
to wonder if the death penalty is enough of a punishment for
the perpetrators of any and all forms of infant circumcision.

<P>I myself have had a circumcision and find that I am very happy 
with the way my penis looks. I feel it is more hygienic. My sex
life is just fine. I am happy with the sensations and so is my
mate. 
I would do it to my child. 

<P>You deserve the Pulitzer Prize.

<P>Many years ago I lost a lot of sleep over the maliciousness
and cruelty of female genital mutilation and got involved with
FORWARD, an organization campaigning against it.
Having taken an interest in the issue I became more and more
frustrated by
assertions that it cannot be compared with male circumcision,
which was
widely thought to be harmless.
I KNEW that almost all my sensitivity was in my foreskin, and
that the
glans was an almost completely insensitive vestigial hook. I had
arguments
with women in pubs, saying "Look, I've GOT one; I know which bits
are
sensitive," but they just wouldn't believe me.
At last I have found your site and a few others, confirming what
I always knew.
I am none the wiser as to what possesses people to attack their
children's genitals.

<P>Just ran across your web page in search of some answers.
I would like to thank you for taking the time and doing a
wonderful job!
I requested my birth records recently. I am planning to write a
letter to the man who botched me up.

<P>I visited your web site last night. I appreciate your 
activism over the years to bring attention and
thoughtful consideration to stop routine infant circumcision. 
Your site contains an awful lot of good stuff.
I hope, as I know you do, that it will advance the cause of
stopping routine infant circumcision.

<P>I was circumcised at birth, like most children of my parent's
religion (notably not my own). As an adult, I feel this was a
gross violation of my personal property. Confusing, I see it,
that the
religious sects that take up arms over abortion are so casual
about the
sexual mutilation of infants. It's the worst and most accepted
form of child abuse, and I am a victim.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I wish more than anything I could do something - anything - press
charges even. The irony and sickening sadness of circumcision,
like infant rape, is that in most states by the time a victim has
become fully aware and an adult, it no longer possible to take
legal
action.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is therefore the government's responsibility to protect infant
rights, and I feel it has failed me. There's no way I can recover 
my own dignity and sexual unit that was so perversely robbed of
me.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Laws need to change. Rape is illegal, yet sexual mutilation -
which is
physically more damaging and likely to be as damaging mentally -
is ENCOURAGED?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first step in purging society of its compulsion to sexually
mutilate
children is to educate, raise awareness, and fight ignorance. As
a
victim, I thank you for your work in this field. Part of me is
destroyed, and my hope is simply that future generations don't
have to
suffer from this barbaric and perverse ritual.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Feel free to post any of my comments, anonymously for obvious
reasons.

<P>Beautiful site.

<P>I applaud you for being so vocal about the issue of
circumcision. Not
enough people in the States are educated about it. It's sad to
see such
ignorance result in an unnecessary surgical procedure that
destroys the
normal function of the penis. I am very bitter about my
circumcision. 
I am now becoming much more outspoken on the issue. Coming out of
the closet has helped.

<P>I have to take your website in small doses. I just read about
<a href="febo.htm"> 
Febo</a>, 
the dog. I used to have a sweet, smart, loving collie who
disappeared one day, along with several other dogs in the
neighborhood.
Now I think I know where they went and it makes me sick. Newborn
babies 
are of course in the same boat as Febo, unable to speak
for themselves, at the mercy of "human" robots who voluntarily
give
themselves over to inhuman institutions. I used to doubt the
existence
of the devil, now I think I know what the devil is. 
Thank you for having the courage to look the beast in the eye.

<P>Awesome site! I really love what
<a href="stern"> Howard Stern</a>
said about circumcision! I have a 
<a href="http://josh.bakehorn.net/circ.html">webpage at
http://josh.bakehorn.net/circ.html</a>
I think you will like. It
is a sarcastic look at the "benefits" of circumcision. I would
very much
like you to link to it from your site. I will definitely put a
link to your site on mine. It's great! 

<P>As far as convincing someone to keep
their son intact, I believe www.SexuallyMutilatedChild.org is a 
well thought out and laid out site. I was in tears through most 
of it. My husband and I had discussed when we
married that if we had any sons they would be left intact.
Unfortunately, no sons. Your site would have convinced me,
especially the mothers' quotes.

<P>I'm pregnant with my first child and do not yet know the sex. 
I was going to have my child circumcised if it was a boy mainly 
because of my husband's wishes. His main reason for wanting this 
procedure was purely aesthetic. Thanks to your site I won't let 
anyone hurt my son.

<P>I found your website to be very informative. My husband and I
feel, however, that we have made the right decision to have our
son
circumcised. My husband was circumcised in his teens for medical
reasons.
Not only does he have no memory of it, but this is his compelling
argument against it. The choice is still a personal one, whether
it be
for aesthetic or medical purpose. His only regret is that he
endured 6
months of pain before agreeing to the procedure. Apparently, it
is the
best thing he could have done.

<P>Your site mentions "all the children throughout history
who have died at the hands of sexual mutilators" yet fails to
even 
acknowledge female circumcision -- only shows 
<a href="fgm1.htm">
two photographs</a> without a followup.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Your site fails to mention the horrors of female circumcision and
how 
this mutilation kills many more young girls than men or boys.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Your site does not mention how female circumcision is an atrocity
not only 
practiced in West, East and Central Africa, but also in Malaysia,
the 
Middle East, and cases have been reported in New Orleans and
France.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If your site begins with "In Memory of the Sexually Mutilated
Child" and 
you only mention male circumcision, you should replace "Child"
with "Boy." 
I was horrified at this lack of mention when the term "child"
never has 
implied "male." Over half a million women and girls are being 
mutilated every year.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By having this site (which contains much information and changed
my 
mind about male circumcision -- if I have a male child, he will
never be 
circumcised) you should mention the thousands of girls dying from 
this, the depression, the suffering, the transmission of AIDS and
how it 
defaces all forms of circumcision.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All forms of circumcision should be eradicated, not just male.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you.

<P>[Posted to the newsgroup alt.circumcision 6/24/99.]
<br>This is a very powerful web site, chock full of emotional
anecdotal reports, impressive scientific facts, and other
shocking information about involuntary infant circumcision.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If there is one child in the world every year who dies from
the experience of the operation known as circumcision, or if
there is one child in the world every year who must
experience sexual transgender surgery because of a lost
penis due to circumcision, then what does that say about
this entire practice, and what do you say to the transgender
survivors who will want answers to the critical questions in
their lives?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Have you been guilty of this crime, or guilty of supporting
the perpetuation of this criminal practice? If so, it is not
too late to stop, and you can follow your religion of choice
while not participating in these acts; ways can be found to
do this, or they already exist and you can discover them.
And it would be wise on your part if you began helping to
alleviate the suffering of babies and children of the world,
as opposed to imposing such pain, suffering, sadness, and
regret upon their beautiful little souls.

<P>I want to comment on your impressive web site. 
<a href="3zones.htm">
The sequence of photos of the intact penis with markings that 
show how the foreskin retracts to produce an impressive area</a>
is very convincing. One could ask,
how could anyone observe this amount of skin covering that is
lost to
circumcision and still proceed? But I suppose the answers are
that 1) Most
parents/doctors giving permission to circumcise never inform
themselves of
the true anatomical loss by viewing your site (or something
similar) and
2) The urge to circumcise is so ingrained in so many people that
DENIAL is
a reflexive action and they just don't accept the obvious facts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The taut skin on the circumcised penis is much too taut during
erection and
penetration to provide any of the gliding sensations experienced
by the
intact penis as the glans is alternately covered and uncovered by
foreskin
during the thrusts of coitus. The increased unpleasant friction
to both partners without the foreskin sleeve should be apparent.

<P>I've read your entire site. It's what motivated me to start 
informing people about circumcision in the first place and one 
of two sites I direct most people to. I've printed large portions 
of it which I keep in a 4" binder in my office.

<P>Hello and greetings from Turkey. Being Turkish and a Moslem, I
was never asked if I wanted to be circumcised. I remember the day
I was circumcised at a hospital. I was 8 years old. The usual age
for circumcision in Turkey is between 6 to 13. No anesthetics are
used. In fact "the child has to suffer the pain!" is the idea.
That is "if he wants to become a real man!" The ceremony involves
a lot of guests invited to watch the child, held motionless by a
strong man (called the "kirve" in Turkish) and his foreskin cut
off. He shouts and screams and cries while the crowd laughs and
the clown sings stupid songs with words like "it is done and
over. It is gone forever." 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My case was a little different. I was circumcised at a hospital
because my parents were semi-ignorant about the whole fact and
they didn't want non sterilized equipment used to cut my foreskin
off. They were never that wise though to realize that actually it
was all unnecessary, and NOT A PART OF ISLAM AT ALL!  Read
through the Koran, and there is not a single mention of it. It is
all because of stupid conservative people who keep telling that
"Hz. Mohammed was born circumcised." "So what?" I ask
skeptically. I am not against religion or Islam. In fact I
believe in Islam, but not as the others interpret it. I believe
in it the way I interpret it. I still feel sorry, hurt, and
desperate to have Islam and stupid traditions as an excuse to
remove my foreskin leaving me with a desensitized penis. Day by
day, year by year, I felt that it lost more and more of its
sensitivity. And although I still have pretty good a sex life, I
fear that if this goes on at this pace, at an age of 40 I may not
be able to feel anything! I don't think I will ever forgive my
parents for what they have done to me. Circumcision reversal may
not give  back everything that's lost but I will go for it JUST
TO PROTEST what has been removed from me.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Few days ago at a major Turkish daily newspaper called "Hurriyet"
there was the news about a child who was afraid of blood and was
to be circumcised. His parents decided he MUST be circumcised.
And also decided that he should be circumcised at a hospital with
the help of laser. But the intensity (or application time?) of
laser was more than required. And his glans started to get more
and more pink. And then they finally realized it was
decaying. His glans was now completely decayed. Now the family is
preparing to sue the doctor. Should they not blame themselves
before the doctor??? The mom says "They have ruined the happiness
and the future of my son." The doctors say "We may attempt to
reconstruct the glans with some plastic surgery when the kid is
18!" But it won't have the sensitivity. The kid is destined to
have a ruined sexuality. An unhappy life. Probably will suffer
emotionally also. And for WHAT!??? Religion? Tradition?? RELIGION
IS GOD'S WORDS? Would God say "Hey, I have created human beings,
but I am afraid I have made a mistake in putting a foreskin on
their glans. Remove it!" CIRCUMCISION IS AGAINST RELIGION! MY
RELIGION THAT IS! ISLAM! And any other REAL RELIGION. This is
simple LOGIC! Is God not able to create human beings with no
foreskins?!  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have digitized the <a href="lasertrk.htm"> 
pages from the newspaper</a>
and I am attaching
these files to this E-Mail. Hope this would count as
"contribution" to your fight. If you decide to publish these on
your web page, please use my initials only and not my full name.
Thank you very much. Best wishes from Turkey.  

<P>I hope there is a special place in hell for circumcisers and
those who 
perpetuate the lies that keep them in business. Plastic, stupid
American 
suburban Moms and their greedy, sadistic pediatricians.

<P>GREAT SITE!

<P>We just got internet service and I visited "Sexually Mutilated
Child" for the first time (I had tried it at the library, but it
was labelled "sexually explicit" and would not come up. What kind
of person would consider that "sexually explicit"?!) After
viewing it, I have to say thank you. It is so tender and I can
feel the love and care you put into it, as well as the anger
towards the circumcisers.

<P>I admire your site more and more every time I visit.
I love your style. Because of your efforts, you saved me
from doing a site just like it!
Thanks for bringing such a site to the public. Keep up
your work. Your site is a benchmark for the other sites
to be compared to.

<P>I am mortified. I am going to use the 
<a href="severed.htm">
4-year-old's severed penis jpg</a>
on the music video I'm making. Do you think it will be a hit 
on MTV?

<P>Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for your web site! As a 28
year old
intact male who has been thinking about getting circumcised for
the past
2 years I have one thing to say. I'm glad I never went through
with it
and now NEVER will. Thank you for opening my eyes and making me
realize
what a sadistic practice it really is. Tomorrow I will hug my
parents
and tell them: "Thank you for not having me cut."

<P>Possibly the most powerful source of information about the
damage 
caused by circumcision available on the internet. [Comment with

<P>I am the mom of intact twin boys, and I want you to know
how much I approve of your web site!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This month's Discover magazine (November) has an article
about the Organogenesis "artificial" skin. The only line in
the article about the foreskin "donors" says something to the
effect of "Organogenesis obtains foreskins from women who
agree before delivery to hand over their sons' DISCARDS"
(emphasis is mine). I want to write a letter to Discover,
objecting to the total lack of respect shown to these
"donors," and further objecting to the calm acceptance of
this practice. On <a href="f4sale.htm">
your page describing the sale of foreskins</a>,
you have a wonderful list of questions (such as 
"Is it ethical to cut off a baby's foreskin, charge his
parents for the operation, sell his foreskin without telling his
parents, and keep the money? Is it legal?") I would like to
use some of these questions, or variations thereof, in my
letter. Would that be OK with you?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you for your dedication to this cause.

<P>Thank you for all of the incredible information. I visited
your site several times before my sons were born in an effort
to obtain as much information as I could. I would like to see
more of this information pushed to child-birth educators. I was
lucky in that the woman who ran the class I took was against
circ, but she didn't have the resources of the internet.  Getting
this information out seems a priority.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On another note, I truly believe that the best way to severely
cut down on circumcisions in America is to get the insurance
companies to stop paying for it. If it isn't paid for, not only
will people think twice about it, but maybe health care
professionals will start going out of their way to explain the
pros and cons (as if there are pros) to parents. I hear from so
many doctors how they don't feel they are in the right in
multilating our children, yet they don't tell the parents how
they feel.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Good work.

<P>One thousand times thank you, for your immense courage in 
exposing circumcision for what it is! I am referring everyone 
I know to your website. Please continue this excellent work.

<P>An extensive collection of poignant and brutally honest text
and explicit pictures that really "Tells it like it is." This
site
pulls no punches, and reveals the essence of circumcision in the
harsh light of open truth. [Comment at 
<a href="http://search.aol.com/">
http://search.aol.com/</a>, 10/29/99. (Search "circumcision".)]

<P>I spent many hours at your site about circumcision and must 
say thank you for the information you've provided. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am pregnant at 5 1/2 months and hadn't thought much about NOT 
having circumcision done if I had a boy. No one ever told me it 
was bad. In fact, of those I've asked their opinion about it since I 
visited your site, they (all men) simply casually replied it was a 
good thing and helped keep the penis clean and "prevent infections." 
After visiting your site, I now know I could never do it to my baby. 
It's not only barbaric in procedure, but the lasting effects are even 
more so. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm 29 years old and have been sexually active since 15. I have agonized
more than I could describe over the fact I've not only never enjoyed 
sexual intercourse but found it physically quite painful. I've cried 
many nights and even lost an 11-year relationship with a man I loved 
because I could no longer emotionally face sex at all. It was traumatic 
and I always assumed there was something wrong with ME. I've seen doctors, 
been to therapy, but found no relief from the physical, emotional and 
spiritual pain. After reading your information about how the male organ 
is naturally designed for comfort and pleasure for both male and female, 
I cried. It made perfect sense and confirmed my own personal discoveries 
about sex: that when large amounts of extra lubrication are provided, 
sex is much more comfortable; that when I once had sex with a man who 
was not circumcised, it was hardly painful at all; that the pain and 
soreness I experienced are identical to the pain and soreness of any 
common skin abrasion. I've learned it isn't my fault after all and I'm 
not abnormal.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm now recently married, and I plan to talk to my husband soon about 
foreskin restoration and plead if I must. It would benefit both of us 
and will hopefully stop any deteriorization of our sexual relationship 
that's already in progress.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you so much for your effort to get the truth out about circumcision.
More people should know, and I don't plan on keeping it secret.

<P>This world is and will be a better place thanks to your efforts 
to educate the public. Your efforts are not in vain!
