<P>Dear Dr. Weiss,

<P>In most medical schools, today and in the past, the subject of the 
immunologic, sexual, erogenous, and gliding action of the foreskin during 
intercourse has been neglected. Anatomy and physiology classes completely 
ignore the foreskin. I look forward to recieving the material you forwarded 
to my office today.

<P>The definition of surgery in the Illinois Medical Practice Act makes secular 
surgery against the law. Prophylactic surgery is a misnomer. Amputating a 
normal healthy body part is a shameful failure of medicine to maintain the 
body's health and integrity.

<P>Surgical treatment requires a patient complaint, diagnosis and an illness.  
In addition, Medicare requires that the surgery meet necessity criteria and 
Severity of Illness and Intensity of Service criteria.

<P>Neither the Church nor the State has any business with their eyes and hands 
in the underwear and on the penises of our children.  

<P>Eileen Marie Wayne, M.D.
