<h3>Amd Other Statements Suggesting That Circumcision
<br>Helps Spread HIV and Sexually Transmitted Diseases</h3>

"It is my hypothesis that the presence of 
<BR>a foreskin predisposes both heterosexual and 
<BR>homosexual men to the acquisition of AIDS."
<BR>Aaron J. Fink, MD
<BR>"Letters," New England Journal of Medicine, 10/29/86,

"The prepuce ... may actually provide a physical or
immunological barrier against infection. That theory is born out
by a new study from the U.S. Army ... [which] found that
circumcised males were 1.65 times as likely to have the most
common sexually transmitted disease there is, Chlamydia."
(Dean Edell, MD, San Francisco Chronicle, June 17, 1987)
<P>
"Several new studies have shown that circumcised
males are at higher risk for developing genital warts, gonorrhea,
syphilis, non-gonococcal urethritis, and HIV infection." (Robert S.
Van Howe, MD, Letter to the American Academy of Pediatrics,
Nov. 17, 1995)
<P>
"Other venereal diseases that do not cause ulcers but
often cause inflammation, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia,
also appear to increase the risk of AIDS infection." ("Host of
factors help spread virus," New York Times Service, The Globe
and Mail, Toronto, Sept. 17, 1990) [Source unconfirmed]
<P>
"[M]ale circumcision is widespread in sub-Sahara
Africa and is performed in many of the areas where AIDS has
been identified. As with the investigation of any postulated risk
factor for AIDS, well controlled epidemiologic studies should
also address the issue of male circumcision." (Letter from Jack
A. DeHovitz, MD [Assistant Medical Director, Spellman AIDS
Program, St. Clare's Hospital, NY], New York State Journal
of Medicine, August 1986)
<P>
"[T]he data also show a somewhat higher incidence
of genital warts, nongonococcal urethritis, and scabies in the
circumcised men ... examination of large numbers of healthy
[circumcised] men in both military and civilian circumstances
discloses a very substantial incidence of persistent suture holes,
microsinuses, skin tabs and bridging, and irregular scarring--all
subject to abrasion and the accumulation of moist debris."
(Letter from John G. Swadey, MD, The New England Journal
of Medicine, June 11, 1987) 
<P>
"It is equally plausible that the AIDS virus enters the
active male partner, involved in vaginal or anal sex, through the
fragile columnal cells lining the urethra. Circumcision removes
the protection normally provided by the foreskin, thus
predisposing the [circumcised] penis to meatal ulceration and
subsequent meatal stenosis ... One could extrapolate his [Dr.
Fink's] hypothesis to suggest that the absence of circumcision
[i.e., the presence of a foreskin] may actually protect against
transmission of AIDS by protecting the urethral mucosa." (Letter
from Robert W. Enzenauer, MD, The New England Journal of
Medicine, June 11, 1987)
<P>
"[B]y the end of the second week [after
circumcision] about 75% of my sensitivity was gone ... my
glans ... [now] requires greater pressure to achieve orgasm ... 
Concerning anal sex, I was never big  on it ... now I seek it
constantly; it is, in a way, a longing for the protective sheath I
have lost--along with its moisture and warmth."
("Circumcision: Prime Cut," by George Desantis, QQ
Magazine, March/April 1976)
<P>
"Some circumcised gay men also seek out intact lovers
for  docking,  placing penises end-to-end so that the foreskin of
the intact penis can be shared with the bare glans of the
circumcised one ... Docking ... would seem to be a high risk
activity, especially if done to orgasm." (Circumcision: What It
Does, by Billy Ray Boyd, Taterhill Press, San Francisco, 1990)
<P>
"[S]ince both circumcision and condoms reduce
sexual sensitivity ... routine circumcision may have helped set
this country up for the AIDS epidemic by increasing the natural
resistance to using condoms ... by depriving men of full sexual
sensation, they [circumcisers] might actually be encouraging the
very forms of sexual relating that are most risky -- unprotected
anal and vaginal intercourse." (Circumcision: What It Does, by
Billy Ray Boyd, Taterhill Press, San Francisco, 1990)
<P>
"The only reason I'm gay is that I was circumcised
when I was a baby. I feel deprived. It's only with an
uncircumcised man that I can have a foreskin." (" Feelings Too
Violent to Describe -- Some Statements About Circumcision
by Circumcised Men," Making America Safe for Foreskins,
by John A. Erickson) [Circumcision didn't "protect" the man
who made this statement from AIDS. He died February 24,
1990, in New Orleans -- of AIDS.]
<P>
"With intravaginal containment of the normal penis, the
male's mobile sheath is placed within the woman's vaginal
sheath. It is impossible to imagine a better mechanical
arrangement for non-abrasive stimulation of the male and female
genitalia than this slick  sheath within a sheath.  Circumcision
destroys this one sheath within a sheath ... I would hazard a
guess, that dyspareunia [painful intercourse] is more common in
the women whose husband is circumcised ... one would be
foolish to discount the circumcised male's immobile penile skin
sheath as an ancillary item contributing to vaginal, abrasive
discomfort ... The male with a penis already moderately
obtunded by circumcision may be less apt to use a condom,
which he feels may further decrease his genital sensitivity ... 
because most American males lack a facile prepuce, the period
of foreplay and dalliance may be abbreviated in the rush to the
intra-vaginal method of penile stimulation. Both these factors
conceivably could be of significance in increasing the rate of
venereal disease, including AIDS." (Say No to
Circumcision! 40 Compelling Reasons Why You Should
Respect His Birthright and Leave Your Son Whole
[manuscript], by Thomas A. Ritter, MD, Hourglass Book
Publishing, 1992)

"We can also wonder whether circumcision, so
frequent in the United States, is not a factor which, since it
brings about the erosion of the ano-rectal mucous during
sodomy, would contribute to the transmission of the H.I.V. virus
-- since we know that tegumentary breaks are the favored
points of entry for this virus." (Medical Treatment of Congenital
Phimosis in the Adolescent, by Doctor Michel Beauge Quimper,
Faculty of Medicine, St. Antoine University, Paris, 1990-1991.

"Intercourse with a circumcised man and intercourse
with an uncircumcised man are two entirely different
experiences. I can always tell from the feeling alone whether or
not a man is circumcised. Circumcised men take longer to
ejaculate. They have to work at it." (From a conversation with
a prostitute)
<P>
"That little operation [the circumcision of her
boyfriend] completely destroyed our life together ... sex
became very painful for me. Twice I had to see a doctor due to
minor infections from chafing. Our beautiful sexual togetherness
became a nightmare of staying creams, lubricants, and
frustrations." (Letter from Carolyn LaRoc, Playgirl, Feb. 1975)
<P>
"[T]he AIDS virus is transmitted ... during a
sexual encounter violent enough to open a blood channel, either
through mucous membranes or broken skin."  ("AIDS," by
John Langone, Discover, Dec. 1985)
