<ul>
Nearly ninety percent of all gentile males are now being 
subjected to the procedure known
as circumcision as compared, for example, to five percent of British 
males ... WHY? 

<P>Circumcision is not and never has been a custom or rite of the 
inhabitants of Europe and
the British Isles, yet it has now been almost universally adopted by 
Western people in ONE area only: the U.S.A. WHY?

<P>Why is the United States the only Western nation that practices 
circumcision routinely to
     such a large degree when only a century ago the only circumcised 
Americans were those who
     belonged to a few esoteric religious cults?

<P>Why does a predominantly Christian nation embrace this procedure 
when there is nothing
     in Christianity or even Atheism which ordains snipping off the 
prepuce of a newborn infant? As
     New Testament readers may remember, the only circumcision St. Paul 
promoted was the
     circumcision of the heart.

<P>Routine Circumcision: The Tragic Myth answers these questions in 
part by explaining how
     modern American doctors and nurses often for financial reasons, often 
for no reason at all,
     persuade American mothers or order an operation that is totally 
unnecessary and frequently leads
     to serious physical and mental complications.

<P>Now ... at last ... the complete story about the psychologically 
compelling mutilation known as circumcision!!!
