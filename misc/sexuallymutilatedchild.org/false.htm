"Informed consent is consent given in full awareness 
<br>of all the known facts and considerations that could 
<br>influence one's decision to give or to withhold consent. 
<br>Consent given without that awareness is <I>mis</I>informed."

One could fill an entire website with sources of the false and
misleading information about the foreskin and circumcision that 
"experts" and "authorities," abetted by the media,
have been systematically purveying to a trusting,
unsuspecting American public for more than a hundred years now. 
Indeed, the history of the foreskin and circumcision in the U.S. 
<I>is</I> a history of false and misleading information.
The purpose of this page is to document that false and
misleading information 
about the foreskin and circumcision is still being propagated. 

<P>If these "experts" and "authorities" aren't aware
of the information on the Checklist below, why aren't they?
If they are aware of it, why do they withhold it?
If they aren't aware of it, they are not experts. 
If they are aware of it but withhold it,
they are guilty of deception by a deliberate act of
omission -- which, in medicine, constitutes malpractice.

<P>The question, then, is: Are those who disseminate
false and/or misleading information about the foreskin and 
circumcision, and those who continue to circumcise children 
and babies, ignorant or lying -- or both?

<br>

<b>CHECKLIST (Information essential for informed choice)</b>

<p>The bottom line -- the one consideration that outweighs all other
considerations combined -- is that <B>infant circumcision is foreskin 
amputation <I>by force</b></i>. When you circumcise a baby, you are cutting 
off a part of his penis that you <I>can</I> cut off only because the
person you're cutting it off of can't protect himself because he 
<I>is</I> a baby. Compared to this one essential consideration,
the points listed below are really "side issues."

<p>Erogenous functions of the foreskin
<br>Protective functions of the foreskin
<br>Immunological functions of the foreskin
<br>Possible functions of the foreskin not yet known or understood
<br>Intact males glad their sex organs are whole and intact
<br>Value intact males place on their sexual wholeness
<br>Circumcised males who would rather their sex organs were 
whole and intact
<br>Circumcised males who have re-covered or are in the process
of re-covering their glans ("foreskin restoration")
<br>Pain
<br>Risks/complications/consequences of circumcision
(death, total loss of penis)
<br>Possible risks/complications/consequences of circumcision not yet 
known or understood
<br>What is lost
<br>Trafficking and marketing of foreskins of circumcised human babies
