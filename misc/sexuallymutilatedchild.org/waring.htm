<P>        Figure 8-7. "This [photograph] is a close up
     lateral view of a surgically restored foreskin. The
     scrotal graft technique was used in this restoration.
     Note the extensive scarring and the growth of pubic
     hair. The scrotal skin is in its relaxed state. When
     contracted it looks like a  prune.  Its owner is a very
     dissatisfied and now wants to have it removed."

     Figure 8-8. "Another view of the same surgical
     restoration. This restoree is now ashamed to show
     himself nude and will only use a stall when urinating
     in public rest rooms. One must see a surgically
     restored foreskin in person to fully realize how fake
     they look."
