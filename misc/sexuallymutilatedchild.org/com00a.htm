There are no words to convey my sorrow for the humiliation and
suffering of this <a href="mohel.htm"> 
baby [having blood sucked from his penis by the mohel]</a>, 
while the adults surrounding him do nothing to help him -- 
indeed they are the willing accomplices in this atrocious act.

<P>While I have no problem with your aims for the site at large,
I feel I should warn you that by spreading the hate-propaganda
that <a href="mohel.htm"> 
Mohels suck blood from a baby's circumcision wound</a>
you are undermining the reliability of your site.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are two parts of Jewish faith which would proscribe the
practice of sucking blood from a circumcision operation:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1) The law against cannibalism. The bible book known in English 
as Leviticus sets out Jewish
dietry restraints. Among many other things it states that
humans can never be Kosher: humans have no split hooves, and
they can't chew the cud. It's clearly stated that consumption
of any part of an unkosher animal is forbidden.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2) Food preparation laws. Part of the rules for preparation of 
food include the fact that the food must be free of all blood. A 
Jew must not drink
the blood of any animal -- even a Kosher one.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I can't imagine what would happen if a Rabbi was present while a
Mohel tried to suck human blood. Presumably there'd be either a
fight or a heart-attack.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The tale you're repeating is part of the hate literature which
is spread by certain anti-Semites.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While I have no problem with your site against the practice of
circumcision in these modern days, the linking of the Jewish
cicumcision ritual with the sucking of blood means that no Jew
will pay much attention to your site, because they know that the
bit about Mohels sucking blood is nonsense.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I hope you find this email useful.

<p>[Yes, I do. After receiving it, I added <a href="mohel.htm">
eight quotes from authoritative sources, including two from the 
Talmud itself, documenting that sucking blood from the
circumcised 
baby's penis is one of the requirements of the Jewish ritual
called bris</a>.]

<P>I sent a printout of some information from In Memory of the
Sexually Mutilated Child to friends who have been pro-circ and
they 
called last night to say they'd visited your website and after
much
exploration on it had changed their long held opinion and decided
their 
child should be left intact to later make the decision for
himself. Great!

<P>I'm reeling, my mind is heaving and my heart is breaking. I
was 
determined this evening to complete my tour of your site in one
sitting 
because I didn't think I could go back. I think now perhaps I
will with
the hope of finding some help with the agony I'm feeling and the
strong
suspicion that I will wake tomorrow the same way.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I didn't know. God help me, I had a moment of doubt, I didn't
understand 
why we routinely do this. I didn't question it enough. My son's
father 
reiterated what I've always heard, that removing the foreskin is
for 
cleanliness and societal acceptance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I feel traumatized by guilt, loss and shame right now, but I'm
also 
looking into the very near future of discussing this with my
young
teenage son. What do I tell him? How can I look into his
beautiful eyes 
and tell him I allowed this to happen? He knows me as his mother
who 
loves him tenderly and deeply, and also as the same person who
would 
smile with her last breath to save him from harm.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Can you help me find a resource to help me deal with my feelings?
I
have to be as strong and supportive of my son as possible.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most importantly, can you tell me where I can find materials to
educate myself on how to approach the subject, some ideas of what
to 
say and what not to say to my child?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If I were ever given the responsibility of raising another boy, I
would leave him intact as he was born. I will discuss MGM and
encourage 
people to research the facts and rethink the idea that this is a
normal, 
practical thing to do. I was researching information on FGM when
I 
found you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a tear in my heart that will never heal. The realization
that
I have mutilated my own child is hardly bearable. They told me it
wouldn't
hurt him, but I too remember hearing him scream. I started for
him, but was
told I could not go into the room to get him once the procedure
had 
started (I was too cowardly to go in). A moment later, a nurse
said he was 
probably crying from being strapped to the table or the cold. I
jumped 
up and said then it's not done yet, but by then the door opened 
and I cradled my baby in my arms, close to my pounding heart. I
felt 
guilty, confused, and weak then as I do now, but can add ashamed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sorry this is so long. This is my first expression. If you
finished 
reading it, thanks for listening. If you know where I might find
some
healing insight, thanks for sharing it.

<P>I hope the page 
<a href="mohel.htm">"mohel.htm"</a> 
will make people disgusted by
circumcision (not just Jewish circumcision, but all
circumcision).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you set up an association in people's minds, you will make
them want 
to puke every time they think about circumcision. That is (I
hope) exactly
how they will feel after reading this page. The feeling of
wanting to puke
is a strong emotion. The association is hard to get rid of during
one's 
entire life. (That's why I still don't eat ketchup.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Too bad most young people will be blocked from seeing your site.
Their minds are the least confused by all of the pseudo-medical
and
religious cover stories for this social sickness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thanks.

<P><a href="mohel.htm">
The picture of the mohel sucking blood from the penis of 
the baby he has just circumcised</a> shocks and sickens me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Could anything be more horrifying than the reality this 
photograph documents? What more proof does one need of the 
criminal psychopathology behind all circumcision advocacy?
How could any rational, humane person look at this photograph 
and not recoil in horror and disgust?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How could any circumcised male who sees this picture not be 
stunned by the realization that he himself might have been 
the victim of such a gruesome perversion when he was a baby 
and that his assailant not only got away with it but got paid 
to do it as well!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How could any civilized human being associate himself with
an ideology that condones -- much less mandates -- such an act?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I keep thinking of Peter Lorre, the serial child killer 
in Fritz Lang's 1931 film "M," who, when finally cornered
and confronted with his horrific crimes, screams out,
"I can't stop myself!" 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If there are people so deranged that they can not stop 
themselves from commiting atrocities against children, then 
it is the duty of society to stop them by whatever means 
necessary. 

<P>I wish I could hear the thoughts of any and all people who
look at the <a href="mohel.htm">
circumciser sucking the baby's penis</a>
page. I doubt that many hardcore circumcision fanatics will be
moved. I am sure, though, that all others will be so
stunned and shocked by the undeniable barbarity and depravity
of what they find here that they will never be able to look
at a ritual or medical circumciser again without shuddering in
disgust.

<P>Parts of your website are so disturbing I can't read them 
or look at them, but I must say I am 100% behind you. Thank you.

<P>I found your website very enlightening. I am a 39 year old
uncircumcised male. I agree that the routine circumcision of
infants is wrong and should be stopped.

<P>I visited your website today and I think it is the most
powerful of all the anticirc websites I have seen.

<P>I looked at your "sexually mutilated child" website last
night. 
It is powerful, and I am glad to see you putting all this
material 
to good use and reaching so many people. The responses from so
many people were especially interesting and insightful.

<P>I peeked at your site and I couldn't get past the first few
photos. 
I'd love to read everything you've got there. 

<P>Just viewed your web site on male circumcision. 
I am 61 yrs old and wish
this was available years ago. I was intact until I was 26 yrs old
and
about to be married. My future wife was informed that I was still
uncircumcised at that time. There was concern about possible
cancers to
myself and to her. So I conceded to having my foreskin removed.
Over
the years I look back and regret this move. I wish I still had my
foreskin. Too bad this information on circumcision was not
readily
available back then. I would hope that more men would visit this
web site. Nice job and pics.

<P>I think your website is absolutely great. I'm so glad to
see it all "out there."

<P>The one thing in your website that set me on edge was the
photos of the 
<a href="mnnngr1.htm">
women being held with knives to their throats next to 
pictures of babies being circumcised</a>. 
Yes, it's a horrific thing to do to babies or 
anyone, but the implication is that the painful operation in
infancy will
turn that person into a murderous psychopath. My reaction is
"let's stick
with the facts, and leave out all this extreme stuff."
I fear that this
type of thing is bound to turn away the uninformed and neutral
general 
public. I've seen people get extremely upset and defensive over
far
gentler, less inflammatory material than this. Still, the pix and 
implications are of value in that they do portray the sheer, raw
ANGER
so many of us feel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am and always will be the mother of circumcised sons, and there
is 
nothing I can ever do to change that. But they are
all loving, open and caring individuals, and haven't turned
into psychopathic murderers or anything like that! I would give
just
about anything to turn back time and have them back as intact
newborns 
again but neither I nor anyone else with circumcised sons can 
ever do that.

<P>Love the display with the 
<a href="peer.htm">
intact boy doll</a>. 

<P>I browsed your website again. It's like a book I can't
put down. I'm glad you include all the comments you receive, 
both positive and negative.

<P>The <a href="1b-exp.htm"> 
12 photos of the baby being circumcised</a>
make me so mad. Look at the horror on this child's face.

<P>I am among the circumcised, and although I believe it is
barbaric and
should be stopped, I also believe that men who spend too much
time
thinking about their penis have serious psychological problems. 
A penis is for pissing and fucking; it doesn't deserve much 
contemplation. I know amputees, permanently and severely
disabled, 
who spend less time lamenting the loss of entire limbs than some
of 
the sad wankers who inhabit your website.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yes, your website performs an important service to humanity, and
I
applaud you. You have tackled a controversial and oft-ignored
subject 
with incredible style, replete with fascinating information.
However, 
those who claim to remember their circumcision "using specialized 
breathing techniques to access intense repressed emotional
states" 
are, bluntly, full of shit, and do the site a disservice. This
same gentleman 
(<a href="brayton.htm">Jerry Brayton</a>) 
also makes the statement: "Like many other boys of my era, I
assumed I had
not been circumcised." Well, I am exactly the same age as Mr.
Brayton, 
and neither I nor anyone in my acquaintance has ever made that
assumption. Mr. Brayton exists in a very tiny minority.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still, the site is marvelous, and I will recommend it to
friends, and link to it from my own site.

<P>I wasn't planning on writing you until I visited one of the 
websites run by a pro-circumcision group.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While your website was highly fact-oriented and gave the medical
reasons
against circumcision, the only thing they did at 
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/2754/">
Circumcision Online News</a> 
was try to slander anyone advocating the preservation of the
foreskin. The only quotes in their section of people speaking
against
circumcision were from terrible bigots. Thank you for providing
truthful medical documentation on a subject that is so
ridiculously rooted in moral instead of ethical arguments.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am a 20 year old circumcised male, and I'm not happy about it.
I
didn't even know that there was such a thing as a foreskin until
I 
was 14 and took a sex ed class in high school. I was astounded. 
The only penises I had ever seen were circumcised. My first
reaction 
upon learning that my body was mutilated was horror, until the
teacher 
extolled the many "virtues" of
circumcision. It wasn't until I came to college and met a friend
who was
uncircumcised that I heard the truth about circumcision from a
non-biased
(uncircumcised) viewpoint. I had been leaning towards the
decision
for a while, but after reading your site I am 100% convinced that
I will
never circumcise any of my future children. I am also going to
tell my
friends to visit your site in the hopes that they will choose not
to
mutilate the natural body of their children as well.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One thing that was particularly interesting to me was where you
pointed out
that in some circumcised men hairy skin from the crotch or
testicle area
will shift onto the shaft of the penis to make up for the lack of
foreskin.
My penis is larger than average, and when I am erect I have hair
growing
on
it fully halfway up the shaft. This always struck me as
unnatural, and
now I know what it is, and why it occurred.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The last thing I want to say regards the smegma pictures.
Apparently most
of
the people who looked at them failed to read your information
below. 
Nobody
cites the crusty stuff you get in the corner of your eye as a
valid
reason to remove your tear ducts. Why should a natural secretion
such
as
smegma be seen as any different? Education is the key to fix our
country's irrational love of circumcision.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thanks for the great site.

<P>In all my years of academic research, I have never come across
a
source of information -- on any topic -- as powerful, insightful,
thorough, and thought-provoking as your website on circumcision.
Most websites provide selected parcels of information to specific
target groups. Your website provides the broadest range of 
information on this topic I have ever encountered. It is a
treasure trove of information.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You do not descriminate, suppress, edit, expurgate, or censor.
Consequently, yours is the only website I am aware of that 
exposes the dark, chilling undercurrents that run through the
history of circumcision.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With their calculated, deceptive rhetoric, the perpetrators of
this atrocity attempt to draw links between an obvious horror and
positive abstractions such as "tradition," "religion," "science,"
"medicine," and "hygiene." The documents and essays on your
website, however, expose this charade and show what the sexual
mutilation of children is really about: 
envy, lust, hatred, male sexual rivalry, sadism,
criminal psychopathology, desperation, ruthlessness, 
power, control, oppression, violence, contempt for humanity,
and greed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is about time that more human rights activists followed your
lead and refused to play the circumcisers' game of evading the
real issues. As your website makes clear, circumcision is not
really about medicine or public health. Circumcision is not
really about preventing or curing any disease. Circumcisers are
not mistaken in their medical beliefs; they are lying.
Circumcision advocacy is really about weaving a convincing
network of lies to deflect the attention of the public and the
criminal justice system from the frightening truth that
circumcisers are really criminally deranged, psychotic,
knife-wielding maniacs driven by psychopathic obsessions and
compulsions that most people could never understand. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Would any
normal person -- would any normal doctor -- pick up a knife and
cut, slash, crush, burn, rip, tear, bloody, and savage a child's
healthy sex organs? Would any normal, healthy adult allow someone
to do that to him? To cover their tracks and to protect their
immunity from being imprisoned for their grisly
crimes, circumcisers are waging a war of terror, oppression, and
violence against the United States and all other countries where
they have infiltrated the corridors of power. Your website
documents these disturbing facts.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you, John Erickson, for having the courage to expose these
frenzied, shrieking, hate-driven fanatics who, blinded by the
sudden light of honest inquiry, now find themselves caught in a
satanic orgy of torture and mutilation involving countless
millions of child victims. They may have escalated their campaign
of lies and terror in recent months, in response to the American
Academy of Pediatrics' 1999 Statement on Circumcision, but thanks
to dedicated scholars and humanitarians like you, the days are
numbered for penis-slashers like Schoen, Weiss, Halperin, Moses,
Kogan, Kunin, Schechet, Bailey, Russell, Wiswell, and the army of
cowards and fools who blindly and slavishly do their bidding.

<P>Thank you, thank you, thank you for putting together a most
comprehensive
site on male circumcision. Oh, I cried and cried reading about
those poor
babies. I have an intact son, and I am so grateful I listened to
my heart
and not my family, my doctors, most of society. I now have
somewhere to
point expectant mothers to so they can see firsthand what they
are
considering doing to their children. Thank you again.

<P>Thank you for compiling the website on the sexually mutilated
child. I absolutely agree with everything said condemning this
brutal operation done on helpless infants without their consent.
I was lucky not to be mutilated in this way. My father was
born to a German and Norwegian couple, and would not
allow this cruelty. As I say, I was lucky.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know so many guys who were cut who can't understand the
sensitivity I have and who don't want to talk about it. Who can
blame them? What good is that to them now? I have also talked
to their girlfriends who believe that the reason their boyfriends
are rough and uncaring in bed is because they are insensitive in
that area. It must be like wearing a permanent thick condom.
There is another victim: the future girlfriends and wives who
won't
be made love to gently because a circumcised guy has to thrust
roughly to feel anything. Or so I'm told.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The recently publicized case of "Brenda," whose penis was cooked
right off at birth and was subsequently made into a girl but who
reclaimed his true gender later, should reach a few more new
parents
with the horror of what can come of circumcision. I am surprised
he
doesn't look up that doctor and thrash him bloody. I won't even
go into
the hypocrisy of forcing a sex change on a baby when adults who
really do want one have to beg and see shrinks for years.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I also think that the 
<a href="index.htm/#millions">
anecdote about the pediatrician's wife
who wanted to circumcise the whole world to prevent another
Holocaust</a> was especially chilling. Talk about getting revenge 
for the past on the backs of the helpless and not responsible.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
About 10 years ago I was at a friend's house. Their son and
daughter
in law had just had a son, and he had been circumcised, even
though
I tried to talk them out of it. I remember that evening the new
mother
laid the baby on the carpet, at his grandfather's feet, and
inspected
the wound. She said it looked like the skin was rolling over the
tip,
so she tried to retract it. She fussed at that with her dry
fingers and
long fingernails for what seemed like 10 minutes while the poor
baby
screamed his lungs out. This wasn't "I want a bottle" or "I want
a hug"
crying. This was absolutely bloodcurdling shrieking. She was
really hurting him. And while I sat there in shocked horror, I
was even
more amazed that nobody in the family did anything. I finally
said, "Why don't you leave him alone?," but I wasn't family, and
nobody
listened. I may never get that out of my mind. Anyway, I hope
people listen to you. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thanks for listening.

<P>For the past week some friends and I have been discussing with
varied
results and opinions the topic of circumcision. Most warranted
untold
awkwardness and wished not to talk about it. Out of the 8, 6
wished not to speak and viewed the topic a moot point since we
can't change the past. The remainder expressed great concern for
the mental well-being of the circumcised population of the Earth.
I
believe that aliens would view this custom strange to say the
least. I
do. I feel that this has caused great trauma to the people of our
world. With an ancient custom that supposedly reduces the
yearning
for sexual stimulation, I believe the lack of full and natural
stimulation to
the brain has caused an overwhelming urge to fulfill the abscence
of
satisfaction and completion in the human male. This adversely
reciprocates upon the human females' emotional well-being too.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am a victim of circumstance. I will never know the usage of
the brain cells that were once linked to my missing 3x5 index
card of
sexual and mental stimulation. Maybe one day the brain will be
able to
be stimulated in such a manner. Then and only then will I
understand what has been robbed from me.

<P>Thank you so much for your web site. It has been so
useful to me in my research. I am trying to help end
this madness. I thank you for what you have done. 

<P>I'm writing to thank you for the work you are doing. 
I was born in 1961. I was 3 months premature and weighed
about 3 pounds. Because of this I was not circumcised at birth. 
My earliest recollections are from around 1969. 
I remember that I had frequent erections whenever I would get
undressed. 
My glans was extremely sensitive to the touch. 
When I turned 12 my mother noticed that
when I retracted my foreskin the frenulum would pull my glans at
an angle
to the shaft of my penis. She took me to the doctor who told my
mom that I
was suffering from congenital phimosis! 
That short frenulum remedied itself in
adulthood when it became torn during masturbation. Today my
foreskin 
retracts easily with no problems. I would not give up my foreskin
without
a fight. I am happy being uncircumcised and don't plan on
changing anytime soon.

<P>With deepest gratitude to you and because it is the best short 
statement of the truth about male genital mutilation that I have
been able
to find anywhere, and because it is the statement that first
showed me that
one can communicate truthfully on this subject and pull no
punches, I have decided to use your 
<a href="iccah.htm">
"Infant Circumcision: Crime Against Humanity,"</a> 
found at
www.sexuallymutilatedchild.org/iccah.htm, in all my major efforts
against human genital mutilation. It will go into all my
literature
packages, all my talks, and everywhere else I can put it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It concludes, "The birthright of males - all males - 
to keep all of the penis they are born with must therefore 
be secured by law."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So be it. Thank you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now we march forward to secure the law that you foresaw.

<P>Thank you for your extensive web site documenting 
RIC [routine infant circumcision]. I am 5
months
pregnant, and although we don't know yet if it's a boy or a girl,
thanks
to the vast information you and others have made available, I
WILL NOT CIRCUMCISE my child.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My question is how to get my circumcised husband to be willing to
read
the information. I've asked him to look into the research, which
he refuses to do. Any suggestions?

<P>Thank you for your site about circumcision.
I am circumcised, and I wish I was not. When my father 
(he told the truth, as far as he knew it) explained to me 
that I was circumcised, I began to be
vaguely disturbed by the idea. I'm 34 and I now 
understand why the loss of my foreskin has been at the edges 
of mind all these years. I'm going to see what can be done, 
if anything, toward restoring my body.

<P>You should be commended for the time and work you have 
put in creating and maintaining this valuable site. I have 
two qustions. First, why can't enough intact MD's and
legislators and parents outlaw circumcision except for 
religious purposes? I know this is watering down the effort 
but it would give it a better chance of gaining public
support. In this enlightened age of self-help and choice, 
why can't this issue make any headway? Second, I have fully
restored my foreskin using a
<a href="http://www.noharmm.org/pud.htm">
P.U.D. [Penile Uncircumcising Device]</a> 
and I am looking for a qualified person to tighten my
foreskin by suturing my dorsal slit. 

<P>I am about to give birth any day to my 6th child. My 
first-born was born to me when I was only 16 years old. I was 
terrified in a way, yet completely in love with him, this I knew
from the beginning.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When I was in the hospital after giving birth (I believe it was
the day 
after), I received a "call" on the intercom from the nurse's
station, 
asking if I wanted my son circumcised. 
Because I had been told after a sonogram that I was expecting a
girl baby, the idea and the reality that I was a mother to a 
son was brand new to me at this point! I don't remember even
thinking about 
circumcision until I received that call. I really was shocked to 
have pushed a little boy into the world!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, I immediately said "NO," loud and clear. "Excuse me???" the
nurse 
replied. "I SAID NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT," I repeated! Well, the next
thing I 
know, this nurse is in my room giving me all sorts of "info" on
why I should reconsider. I distinctly remember telling her that
if anyone dared to try to 
lop off a hunk of my beautiful son's body, I would kill them with
my bare hands. I meant exactly what I said. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then the pediatrician tried to talk me into it. 
He received much the same adamant response from me. Now, looking
back, I 
really don't think any of them quite expected a 16 year old
single mom to stick up for her newborn like this. 
I was highly uninformed about pregnancy and labor. 
I went to a clinic for prenatal 
care, from the beginning stating that I wanted to give birth
naturally, and 
wanted no part of drugging my baby. They really didn't know quite
what to do 
with me. I never received any info on "Lamaze" or anything like
that. I was 
told how to breathe when in labor, that's about it. Still, I
knew, somehow, what I wanted for my baby.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How is it, then, that even a scared teenager, who had been living
with the 
baby's 23 year old alcoholic father in the back room of a 6
bedroom house
shared with 27 other people, HOW, I ask, could <I>I KNOW</I> 
that to mutilate a brand-new baby was the 
sickest, most violent, twisted notion I had ever heard, yet there
are people 
in much more of an "educated" and economically "sound" situation
who would actually choose to commit such a crime against their
most cherished "accomplishment"??? I will never understand it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I hate them. If I could get away with it, I would surely make an
attempt on 
their lives. The fury and the rage I feel against these people
and the 
doctors who perform these abominations is indescribable. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I just forced myself 
to look at some of the pictures you have on your website, with my
INTACT son, 
who is now nearly 15. I will never, ever forget these pictures.
<a href="jenkins.htm">
The one with the baby screaming, mouth open so wide with terror, 
completely shocked by what is happening to him</a>, will haunt me
to 
my grave. I literally broke down while looking at it. The feeling 
came up from the very pit of my soul, and I felt that baby's
horror, 
his absolute pain, and it is coursing through me to this moment.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One thing eased me, ever so slightly, and one thing only. My son,
my dear, 
wonderful young man, grabbed me and held me so tight. He said,
"Ma, you 
didn't do it" over and over again, and I hugged him for dear
life. He 
understood, probably for the first time in his life, what being
"intact" 
meant. The difference between what could have been for him and
what IS, is my only consolation. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My second son was born ten years after his big brother, and his 
daddy knew by the look on my face when I said I'd NEVER allow it,
that to even TRY to change my mind would result in some 
frying-pan-to-the-head 
action that would not soon be forgotten! And now, in just a few
days, maybe 
even hours, I will have another baby in my arms. Normally I don't
care one 
way or the other about the sex, as long as the baby is healthy,
as they say. 
Something in me really, really wants a boy now, just to know
there is another non-mutilated, perfect baby boy in the world,
whose mommy loves him and marvels in just how perfect he is.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I just wanted you to know that your site will be one I send
people to, every 
chance I get, when this subject comes up, as it has been on a
"list" I'm on. Shockingly enough, it's a list of aspiring
midwives and many "requested" that I "back down" on the whole
thing, and were quite aghast that I referred to circumcision as
"mutilation"! (HOW DARE I???)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you so much for all of the REAL information you are
providing! I am eternally grateful. 

<P>My thanks to you for your constant efforts to educate 
and enlighten people about this. Thank you for adding mine
<a href="books.htm">
[You Call This Love? The Real Reason Women Don't Like Sex]</a> 
to the book list. I hope our story will help people make 
the right decision for sake of the children.

<P>Personally, I'm a pro-circumcision type person. I
think circumcision promotes 
cleanliness and, by reducing oversensitiveness of the
parts, helps to correct any 
tendency which may exist to improper manipulations of
the genital organs and the 
consequent acquirement of evil sexual habits, such as
masturbation. I was 
circumcised right after I was born and I don't miss
having a foreskin one bit at all.  
Circumcisors are just doing their jobs. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But that's
not all I want to talk about. I read  
the story on your website called 
<a href="febo.htm">
"He Didn't Even Cry" / Febo</a>,
about someone  
who lost their beloved dog and later found him at
this veterinary university with 
his stomach cut open and with probes inserted into him
for experimental reasons along 
with several other dogs. THIS STORY BOTH SADDENED AND
ENRAGED ME!!! 
WHO WOULD ALLOW SOMETHING AS AWFUL AS THAT TO HAPPEN? 
I would like to offer that 
person my greatest respects for their lost dog. But
one question remains. What's a 
story about someone who lost their dog to experimental
purposes doing on an 
anti-circumcision web site? I think that story would
work much better and be better 
seen on an Animals' Rights website. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But getting back to the point, I also think that any 
uncircumcised men in the world need to be circumcised
in order to know what already circumcised men feel.  
And to all those men who were circumcised as adults and who 
once knew the pleasures of a foreskin let me just say
one thing to all of you: "WELCOME TO THE OTHER SIDE!!!" 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And 
<a href="f4sale.htm">
one section of your website stated that discarded foreskins 
were sold to biotechnology industries for research.</a> 
I think this is a very good thing. Those nasty little skins
are going towards useful purposes to help create a better future. 

<P>You have a wonderful web site. It saddens me very much to 
realize what I've lost as someone who was circumcised. I cannot 
masturbate to climax even though I have wet dreams; whether that 
has to do with my circumcision, I do not know, but I believe it 
does. One thing's for sure: I will leave any son I have intact.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Please organize your web site though. It is very difficult to
find things by subject matter or by date.

<P>I have a four month old son who after much debate and reading
on my
fiance's and my part we decided not to circumcise. My man is not
circumcised either. Not only is sex much better with an
uncircumcised
man (I have been with both), but after reading those articles and
seeing
those pictures I could not imagine putting my beautiful wonderful
little
piece of heaven I call my son through that. Any parent who is
even
considering having their child circumcised should have to either
see the
pictures or a video, then if they decide to still have it done
they should
be smacked around or have their child taken away. It is a
barbaric and
mean thing to do, how can they say that it causes the baby no
pain? Can't
they see their little faces distorted by their cries! Just the
thought of
my son, or any other baby for that matter, laying there on that
table
strapped down and screaming while someone in a hospital robe and
mask 
hovers over them cuts off part of that helpless baby makes me 
terribly angry and makes me want to cry. These people should be 
stopped!!!!!!!!!!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thanks for letting me rant, this is just something I feel very
strongly about. Hopefully some other expecting parents will visit
these
sites and not let those people who don't know talk them into
killing part of their little piece of heaven.

<P>I've just visited your site and have a few things to say. The 
23 y/o male who said that 90% of the girls he spoke with thought
an
uncut guy was "disgusting" -- I think that may be a conservative
number like closer to 99.99%. If you're a male and not cut and
living 
in the States your sexual happiness and comfort will never be
completely 
fulfilled due to the 90% of the women in this country with that
attitude 
he described. I'm not cut and will NEVER date ANY American woman
for this 
very reason. I'm not ugly and have a nice body -- everywhere. I'm
lucky 
because I travel to Europe on business 4-6 times a year and feel
so good 
about myself when I'm there (circumcision is unheard of there)
and when 
I'm with their women. My present girlfriend (German) was outraged
when I 
told her this attitude all American women have towards
circumcision, yet 
she wasn't surprised. I have a very positive outlook on life and
look
forward to meeting the EUROPEAN woman of my dreams (if I haven't
already). 
I know this may sound harsh but I could never talk negatively
enough
about the judgmental attitude of American women towards sex with
a
natural man. And besides European women ARE TRULY better!

<P>FUCK YOU. STAY OUT OF MY BUSINESS. I'm glad I'm circumcised. 
It's easy to clean and girls aren't scared of it. I don't feel 
like a freak. Sure long ago that was me strapped to 
<a href="post1.htm">that board</a>
bawling, but that was a long time ago. Guess what? I don't feel 
a thing anymore, and I don't remember it. So fuck off and leave 
us out of your bullshit.
