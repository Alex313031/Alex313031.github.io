<br>examinations [of 35 intact and 35 circumcised males]."

"The testimony of men who have experienced life
<br>with a foreskin and then lost it is perhaps the 
<br>most damning of all arguments against circumcision." 
<br>William E. Krueger, circumcised at 30

     "Wearing a condom or wearing a glove ... sight
without color would be a good analogy ... only being able to
see in black and white ... rather than seeing in full color
would be like experiencing an orgasm with a foreskin and
without. There are feelings you'll just never have without the
foreskin." (Paul Tardiff, circumcised at 30, <I>NOCIRC
Circumcision
Video</I>, by Marilyn Milos, RN, and Sheila Curran, RN) 
<P> 
     "Eight weeks ago I was circumcised ... In order to
adjust to the exposure of a previously protected glans I
used ... Nupercainal for about a week ... [then] the glans
was permitted to  dry  and  peel  (in much the same way that
skin peels after a sunburn); by the end of the second week the
process was completed and about 75% of my sensitivity was
gone ... whereas brushing my hand against the glans before
circumcision would drive me up a wall, now I could comfortably
rub it ... My first ejaculation was a totally new sensation; the
glans actually felt  naked  afterwards, throbbing with blood and
sensitive to the cool air ... it almost ached for the protection
of a warm sheath, which would never be possible again ... I
will eventually have about 90% less sensitivity than before.
Startling as this might seem to most circumcised guys, it is
quite true--and should give them some idea of the intensity of
sensations they have never known. I used to experience great
pleasure in touching myself, or in masturbating even during sex.
That pleasure no longer exists ... Because I have lost so
much physical feeling I must now rely heavily on mental
stimulation to achieve orgasm ... I am constantly on the
lookout for new ways or mechanical gadgets that provide
greater mental and physical stimulation--simply to experience the
sensations previously achieved with hand strokes alone ...
Now an orgasm is an achievement, and if I am not  turned on 
experiencing it is sheer work. Because so much feeling has left
I seek intensified stimulation ... though my glans is less
sensitive, overall, it is more sensitive to scraping, etc.
because
it has no protective covering, and because it is less sensitive
it
requires greater pressure to achieve orgasm ... Concerning
anal sex, I was never  big  on it ... Now I seek it constantly;
it is, in a way, a longing for the protective sheath I have
lost--
along with its moisture and warmth ... Those who were
circumcised as infants cannot imagine what pleasurable
sensations were destroyed at the outset." ("Circumcision:
Prime Cut," by George Desantis, <I>QQ Magazine</I>, March/April
1976)
<P>
     "I experimented with Scotch Tape and kept the
foreskin taped back ... but the chafing on the knob was
painful at the end of the day and I could not imagine how
anyone could be circumcised and endure that pain ... after
my circumcision, I experienced that same irritation; it lasted
two
weeks and then one day I woke up and the knob felt nothing --
all the nerve ends had died over night." (From a letter to
Rosemary Romberg, author of <I>Circumcision: The Painful
Dilemma</I>, from a man in Canada, circumcised at 28) 
<P>
     "My newly naked glans [after the operation] was
protected from irritation with bandages ... Slowly the area
lost its sensitivity and as it did I realized I had lost
something
rather vital. Stimuli that had previously aroused ecstasy had
relatively little effect ... The acute sensitivity never
returned.
Something rather precious to a sensual hedonist had been lost
forever ... My experience ... is ... that circumcision
destroys a very joyful aspect of the human experience for both
males and females." (NOCIRC Newsletter) [Date?] 
<P>
      "The greatest disadvantage of circumcision, in my
view, is the awful loss of sensitivity and function when the
foreskin is removed ... I was deprived of my foreskin when I
was 26; I had ample experience in the sexual area, and I was
quite happy (delirious, in fact) with what pleasure I could
experience--beginning with foreplay and continuing--as an intact
male. After my circumcision, that pleasure was utterly gone. Let
me put it this way: On a scale of 10, the uncircumcised penis
experiences pleasure that is at least 11 or 12; the circumcised
penis is lucky to get to 3 ... If American men who were
circumcised at birth could know the deprivation of pleasure they
would experience, they would storm the hospitals and not
permit their sons to undergo this unnecessary loss. But how
can they know? You have to be circumcised as an adult, as I
was, to realize what a terrible loss of pleasure results from
this
cruel operation." (From a letter to Marilyn Milos, RN,
Founder/Director of NOCIRC)
<P>
     "After thirty years in the natural state, I allowed
myself to be persuaded by a physician to have the foreskin
removed -- not because of any problems at the time, but
because, in the physician s view, there might be some problems
in the future. That was five years ago, and I am sorry I had it
done now from my standpoint and from what my female sex
partners have told me ... the sensitivity in the glans had been
reduced by at least 50%. There it is unprotected, constantly
rubbing against the fabric of whatever I am wearing. In a
sense, it had become calloused. Intercourse is now (as we used
to say about the older, heavier condoms) like washing your
hands with gloves on ... I seem to have a relatively
unresponsive stick where once I had a sexual organ." (S.J.,
Denver [quoted], <I>Say No to Circumcision! 40 Compelling
Reasons</I>, by Thomas J. Ritter, MD, and George C. Denniston,
MD, 
Hourglass Book Publishing, 1996)
<P>
     "I did decide to get circumcised at age 28, mainly
because I had heard that it was much easier to  keep
clean ... I found that the negatives of circumcision far
outweighed the minor benefit of a slight improvement in
hygiene. I wound up being very sorry that I had become
circumcised because of a major loss of sexual enjoyment after
the circumcision. I found that the loss of my foreskin led to a
 drying out  of the head of my penis and a resulting loss of
sensitivity ... But the biggest factor in the loss of sexual
enjoyment was that I no longer had a foreskin to massage the
head of my penis during intercourse and masturbation. I no
longer had skin moving tightly back and forth across the head
of my penis, which had provided a great deal of pleasure
previously. I still consider the decision to get circumcised the
biggest mistake in my life." (R.P. [quoted], Tulsa, <I>The Joy
of
Uncircumcising!</I>, by Jim Bigelow, PhD, Hourglass Book
Publishing, 1995)
<P>
     "There are no words to describe how powerful, how
compelling a penis with a foreskin is and how one's life
revolves around it ... Circumcision did not eliminate
masturbation, but it took away its intense pleasure, its extreme
sweetness ... it was wet like the inside of my mouth
for 25 years ... I wanted everyone who had not been through
it to experience it ... Circumcision is ... getting it [one's
penis] back broken, bleeding, in great pain, with its most
delicate, sensitive parts ... cut off, permanently weakened ... 
the glans eventually dried out (a process that took over a year) 
... Before circumcision my erections would be extremely
strong ... Now the erection is weaker and the penis does not
get so terribly stiff." (From a letter to Rosemary Romberg,
author of <I>Circumcision: The Painful Dilemma</I>, from a man in
Florida, circumcised at 25)
<P>
     "My wife would chew on my foreskin. That would
drive me out of my mind. Now I think someone could chew the
head off and I might not feel it." (Private communication from
a man circumcised in his early 30's)
<P>
     "I had myself circumcised when I was 21, the worst
mistake I ever made in my life." (Letter, NOCIRC Newsletter,
Spring 1992)
<P>
     "[O]ne of the biggest mistakes of my life. I feel
damaged on every level. Sexual pleasure has been reduced by at
least 70% both in intensity and range of sensations ... The
testimony of men who have experienced life with a foreskin and
then lost it is perhaps the most damning of all arguments
against circumcision ... For an adult male to be misled into
circumcision is regrettable, but to inflict irreparable damage on
a non-consenting infant who will carry the physical and
psychological scars all his life is tragic -- and a crime."
