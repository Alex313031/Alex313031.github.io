<blockquote>
I have always despised being circumcised. Sometimes I
can barely function at work. I think about suicide. Words
cannot describe the rage I feel toward the pervert who did
this to me. There's something deranged about anyone who
persists in circumcising babies after being confronted with
the facts. I recently saw the movie <I>Schindler's List</i>, and it
struck me that these are the same butchers who were
murdering Jews in Nazi Germany. I think that every society
has these "closet sadists" who emerge only when societal
constraints are removed. They have now found their niche as
contemporary doctors who circumcise. For a brief moment they
are God, with total control over another's sexuality. It's
the perfect crime. Sanctioned by unsuspecting, misinformed
parents, the hospital, and an ignorant society, they hide
under the guise of a respected medical profession. And the
consequences only appear years later when they are long gone
and their trail cold. Some doctors really don't know any
better, and when told about the gravity of their actions,
stop. But some just keep on cutting. There's something
really frightening about the Finks and Wiswells and Gelbaums
of our society. You're  right -- it's not circumcision that
needs to be studied; it's circumcisers.
