ABSTRACT. Existing scientific evidence demonstrates 
potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; 
however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine
neonatal circumcision. In circumstances in which there are 
potential benefits and risks, yet the procedure is not 
essential to the child's current well-being, parents should
determine what is in the best interest of the child. To make 
an informed choice, parents of all male infants should be 
given accurate and unbiased information and be provided the
opportunity to discuss this decision. If a decision for
circumcision is made, procedural analgesia should be
provided.</FONT>

<P><BIG><B>A</B></BIG>lthough<SUP>1</SUP> the exact frequency is
unknown, it is 
estimated that 1.2 million newborn males are circumcised in the
United States 
annually at a 
<A href="http://www.cirp.org/library/procedure/garry/">
cost</A> of 
between $150 and $270 million. This practice has been 
advocated for reasons that 
vary from symbolic ritual to preventive health measure. 
Until the last half 
century, there has been limited scientific evidence to 
support or repudiate the 
routine practice of male circumcision. 

<P>Over the past several decades, the American Academy of
Pediatrics has 
published several policy statements on neonatal circumcision of
the male 
infant.<SUP>1-3</SUP> Beginning in its 1971 manual, 
<A href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap#1971">
<I>Standards and 
Recommendations of Hospital Care of Newborn Infants</I></A>, 
and reiterated in the 
<A href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap#1975">
1975</A> and 1983 
revisions, the Academy concluded that there was no absolute
medical indication for routine circumcision. 

<P>In 
<A href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/aap#1989">
1989</A>, 
because of new research on circumcision status and urinary tract
infection (UTI) 
and sexually transmitted disease (STD)/acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome, the 
Academy concluded that newborn male circumcision has potential
health benefits 
and advantages as well as disadvantages and risks.<SUP>4</SUP>
This statement 
also recommended that when circumcision is considered the
benefits and risks 
should be explained to the parents and informed consent obtained.
Subsequently, 
a number of medical societies in the developed world have
published statements 
that do not support routine circumcision of male newborns,
<SUP>5-7</SUP> In its 
<A href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/acp1996/">
position statement</A>, the Australian College of 
Paediatrics emphasized that in all cases, the medical 
attendant should avoid exaggeration of either the risks or 
benefits of this procedure.<SUP>5</SUP>

<P>Because of the ongoing debate, as well as the publication of
new research, it 
was appropriate to reevaluate the issue of routine neonatal
circumcision. This 
Task Force adopted an <A 
href="http://www.meddean.luc.edu/library/ebm.htm">evidence-based
</A> approach to 
analyzing the medical literature concerning circumcision. The
studies reviewed 
were obtained through a search of the English language medical
literature from 
1960 to the present and, additionally, through a search of the
bibliographies of 
the published studies. 

<P><A name=incidence>

<P align=center><B>
<A href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/">
EPIDEMIOLOGY</A></B> 

<P>The percentage of male infants circumcised in infancy varies
by geographic 
location, by religious affiliation, and to some extent, by
socioeconomic 
classification. Circumcision is uncommon in Asia, South America,
Central America, and most of Europe. In 
<A href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/Canada/">
Canada</A>, ~48% of males 
are circumcised.<SUP>8</SUP> Some groups such as followers of the
Jewish and 
Islamic faiths practice circumcision for religious and cultural 
reasons.<SUP>9,10</SUP> 

<P>There are few data to help estimate accurately the number of
newborn males 
circumcised annually in the United States. According to the 
<A href="http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/USA/">
National Center for Health 
Statistics</A> (NCHS), 64.1% of male infants were circumcised in
the United 
States during 1995 (unpublished data, 1997). However, data from
the NCHS are 
based on voluntary collection of data from participating
hospitals; &lt;5% of 
hospitals in the United States participate. Thus, NCHS data
provide an 
inadequate sample to estimate national circumcision frequency. 

<P>More specific data on circumcision rates are &gt;1 decade old.
Data obtained 
from hospital records in metropolitan Atlanta, GA, document
circumcision rates 
of 84% to 89% in the period 1985 to 1986.<SUP>11 </SUP>This study
demonstrated 
that hospital discharge data, which rely on medical record face
sheet 
information, underestimate the true incidence of neonatal
circumcision. Using 
such hospital discharge data, it was estimated that 45.5% of male
infants born 
in New York City and 69.6% of male infants born elsewhere in New
York State were 
circumcised at birth in the year 1985.<SUP>12</SUP> In addition,
none of these 
sources included rates for ritual circumcision or subsequent
outpatient 
procedures, thus, these rates of circumcision are even more
likely to be 
understated. 

<P>Differences in circumcision rates related to demographic
variables are not 
well described. One 
<A href="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/laumann/">
study</A>, which surveyed 
adult men, suggested that in the United States, the frequency of
circumcision 
varies directly with maternal education, a marker for
socioeconomic 
status.<SUP>13</SUP> Circumcision rates also vary among racial
and ethnic 
groups, with whites considerably more likely to be circumcised
than blacks or 
Hispanics (81% vs 64% vs 54%).<SUP>13</SUP>

EMBRYOLOGIC AND ANATOMIC<BR>CONSIDERATIONS</A></B> 
<P>Embryologically, the penis glans derives from the genital
tubercle, which has 
developed by 4 to 6 weeks gestation. The primitive urethral folds
present in the 
male human embyro fuse to form the penile urethra. The genital
swellings, 
present early in development, subsequently become the scrotum in
males. The skin 
of the body of the penis begins growing forward at about 8 weeks
gestation and 
covers the glans eventually. Initially, <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/deibert/">squamous
epithelium has no 
separation between the glans and the foreskin</A>. Separation of
epithelial 
layers that may be only partially complete at birth progress with
development of 
desquamated tissue in pockets until the complete separation of
tissue layers 
forms the <I>preputial space</I></A>. As a result of the
incomplete separation, 
the prepuce or foreskin may not be fully retractable until
several years after 
birth. In <A
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/gairdner/">~90% of 
uncircumcised males, the foreskin is retractable by age 5
years</A>. <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/oster/">Partial
adhesions with smegma 
accumulation may persist in small numbers of uncircumcised males
through 
childhood and even into adolescence</A>.<SUP>14-16</SUP> 

<P>Epidermal keratinization occurs on the skin of the penile
shaft but not on 
the mucosal surface of the foreskin.<SUP>15</SUP> One <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/">study</A>
suggests that there 
may be a concentration of specialized sensory cells in specific
ridged areas of 
the foreskin but not in the skin of the penile shaft. There are
conflicting data 
regarding the <A
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/STD/fleiss3/">immune 
capabilities of preputial tissue</A>. Studies differ on the
number, 
distribution, and location of Langerhans' cells in the
foreskin.<SUP> 
18,19</SUP> No controlled scientific data are available regarding
the differing 
immune function in a penis with or without a foreskin. 

<P><A name=problems>

<P align=center><B><A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/vanhowe/">PENILE 
PROBLEMS</A></B> 

<P>Penile problems may develop in both circumcised and
uncircumcised males. The 
true frequency of these problems is unknown. In one 8-year <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/oster/">study</A> of a
cohort of 1948 
uncircumcised Danish schoolboys between 6 and 17 years of age, 4%
of the boys 
had phimosis (which prevented the foreskin from being retracted
by gentle 
manipulation) and 2% had "tight foreskin" so that the foreskin
could be 
retracted but with slight difficulty.<SUP>16 </SUP>

<P>The only longitudinal <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/fergusson/">study
</A> to address 
this issue in both circumcised and uncircumcised boys followed a
birth cohort of 
500 New Zealand boys until the age of 8 years; it was noted that
the 
relationship between risks of penile problems and circumcision
status varied 
with the child's age.<SUP>20 </SUP>The majority of these problems
were described 
as penile inflammation and were noted to be relatively minor. In
this study, 
circumcised infant boys had a significantly higher risk of penile
problems (such 
as meatitis) than did uncircumcised boys, whereas, after infancy,
the rate of 
penile problems (such as balanitis and inflammation of the
foreskin) were 
significantly higher in older uncircumcised boys. 

<P>A retrospective study conducted at two inner city clinics
asked parents of 
boys 4 months to 12 years of age to recall whether their sons had
ever developed 
any penile problems. Hispanic parents constituted 73% of those
responding. 
Although parents of uncircumcised boys reported an increased
number of medical 
visits for penile problems, the frequency of balanitis and
irritation was not 
significantly different between circumcised and uncircumcised
boys.<SUP>21</SUP> 
In addition, most problems reported were minor. Case reports
suggest an 
increased frequency of paraphimosis in the uncircumcised elderly
men who require 
intermittent or chronic bladder catheterization.<SUP>22-24</SUP>
Other case 
reports indicate that balanitis occurs more frequently in
uncircumcised men than 
in circumcised men and suggest an increased frequency of
balanitis in men with 
diabetes and in uncircumcised soldiers during
wartime.<SUP>25</SUP> 

<P>Chronic inflammation of the foreskin may result in a secondary
phimosis 
caused by scarring.<SUP>23-28</SUP> <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/wright/">
Medical therapy</A> 
has been successful in resolving both secondary
phimosis and <A

paraphimosis</A>, 
but <A

surgical 
intervention</A> is sometimes indicated.<SUP>23,26-28</SUP> 

<P><A name=hygiene>

<P align=center><B>THE ROLE OF HYGIENE</A></B> 

<P>Circumcision has been suggested as an effective method of
maintaining <A 
href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/pam4.html">penile hygiene</A>
since the time 
of the Egyptian dynasties, but there is little evidence to affirm
the 
association between circumcision status and optimum penile
hygiene. 

<P>In one study, appropriate hygiene decreased significantly the
incidence of 
phimosis, adhesions, and inflammation, but did not eliminate all 
problems.<SUP>29</SUP> In this study, 60% of parents remembered,
receiving <A 
href="http://www.aap.org/family/uncirc.htm">instructions on the
care of the 
uncircumcised penis</A>, and most followed the advice they were
given. Various 
studies suggest that genital hygiene needs to be emphasized as a
preventive 
health topic throughout a patient's
lifetime.<SUP>16,21,29,30</SUP>

<P align=center><B>SEXUAL PRACTICE, <A

AND<BR>CIRCUMCISION 
STATUS</B> 

<P>A <A
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/laumann/">survey of
adult 
males</A> using self-report suggests more varied sexual practice
and less sexual 
dysfunction in circumcised adult men.<SUP>13</SUP> There are <A 
href="http://www.sexuallymutilatedchild.org/feelings.htm">
anecdotal reports</A> 
that <A
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/money/">penile 
sensation</A> and <A href="http://www.noharmm.org/bju.htm">sexual 
satisfaction</A> are decreased for circumcised males. <A 
href="http://www.noharmm.org/masters.htm">Masters and Johnson</A>
noted no 
difference in exteroceptive and light tactile discrimination on
the ventral or 
dorsal surfaces of the glans penis between circumcised and
uncircumcised 
men.<SUP>31</SUP> 

<P><A name=methods>

<P align=center><B><A
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/procedure/">METHODS OF 
CIRCUMCISION</A></B> 

<P>There are three methods of circumcision that are commonly used
in the newborn 
male. These are all include the use of devices: the <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/procedure/gomco/">Gomco</A>
clamp, the <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/procedure/plastibell/">
Plastibell</A> device, 
and the <A
href="http://blues.fd1.uc.edu/~reynolrd/html/rdr5.html">Mogen</A> 
clamp (or variations derived from the same principle on which
each of these 
devices is based). 

<P>The elements that are common to the use of each of these
devices to 
accomplish circumcision include the following: estimation of the
amount of 
external skin to be removed; dilation of the preputial orifice so
that the glans 
can be visualized to ensure that the glans itself is normal;
bluntly freeing the 
inner preputial epithelium from the epithelium of the glans;
placing the device 
(at times a dorsal slit is necessary to do so); leaving the
device in situ long 
enough to produce hemostasis and amputation of the foreskin. 

<P>It is important that those who practice circumcision become
sufficiently 
skilled at the technical aspects of the procedure so that <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/williams-kapila/"
>
complications</A> 
can be minimized. Those performing circumcision should be adept
at suturing to 
ensure that hemostasis can be secured when necessary and that
skin edges can be 
brought together if they should separate widely. If circumcision
is done in the 
newborn period, it should be performed only on infants who are
stable and 
healthy.

<P align=center><B><A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications">COMPLICATIONS OF
THE 
CIRCUMCISION<BR>PROCEDURE</A></B> 

<P>The true <A
href="http://www.noharmm.org/incidenceUS.htm">incidence of 
complications</A> after newborn circumcision is
unknown.<SUP>32</SUP> Reports of 
two large series have suggested that the complication rate is
somewhere between 
0.2% and 0.6%.<SUP>33,34</SUP> Most of the complications</A> that
do occur are 
minor.<SUP>35</SUP> The most frequent <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/kaplan/">
complication</A>, 
bleeding is seen in ~0.1% of circumcisions.<SUP>35 </SUP>It is
quite rare to 
need transfusion after a circumcision because most bleeding
episodes can be 
handled quite well with local measures (pressure, hemostatic
agents, cautery, 
sutures), Infection is the second most common of the
complications, but most of 
these infections are minor and are manifest only by some local
redness and 
purulence.<SUP>35</SUP> There also are isolated case reports of
other 
complications such as recurrent phimosis, wound separation, <A

<A

circumcision with 
such rare events as scalded skin syndrome, <A

<P><A name=late>

<P align=center><B>CIRCUMCISION AFTER THE NEWBORN PERIOD</B> 

<P>Should circumcision become necessary after the newborn period
because 
problems have developed, general anesthesia is often used and
requires a more 
formal surgical procedure necessitating hemostasis and suturing
of skin edges. 
Although the procedural complications are generally the same as
in newborn 
circumcision, there is the <A
href="http://www.noharmm.org/evansdeath.htm">added 
risk attendant to general anesthesia</A> if it is used.
Additionally, there is 
morbidity in the form of time lost from school or work to be
considered. 

<P><A name=analgesia>

<P align=center><B><A
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/">ANALGESIA</A></B> 

<P>There is <A
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/anand/">considerable 
evidence that newborns who are circumcised without analgesia
experience pain and 
physiologic stress</A>. Neonatal physiologic responses to
circumcision include 
changes in heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/gunnar/">cortisol
levels</A>.<SUP>36-39</SUP> One <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2/">report</A> has
noted that 
circumcised infants exhibit a stronger pain response to
subsequent routine 
immunization than do uncircumcised infants.<SUP>40</SUP> Several
methods to 
provide analgesia for circumcision have been evaluated. <A
name=EMLA>
<H4>Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA Cream)</H4><A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/EMLA/">EMLA</A>
cream, 
containing a 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine, attenuates the
pain response to 
circumcision when applied 60 to 90 minutes before the procedure.
Compared with 
placebo groups, neonates who had EMLA cream applied spend less
time crying and 
have smaller increases in heart rate during
circumcisions.<SUP>41-43</SUP> The 
analgesic effect is limited during the phases associated with
extensive tissue 
trauma such as during lysis of adhesions and tightening of the 
clamp.<SUP>45,49</SUP> 

<P>Ideally, 1 to 2 g of EMLA cream is applied to the distal half
of the penis, 
which is then wrapped in an occlusive dressing. There is a
theoretic concern 
about the potential for neonates to develop methemoglobinemia
after the 
application of EMLA cream, because a metabolite of prilocaine can
oxidize 
hemoglobin to methemoglobin. When measured, blood levels of
methemoglobin in 
neonates after the application of 1 g of EMLA cream have been
well below toxic 
levels.<SUP>42-46</SUP> Two cases of methemoglobinemia in infants
occurred after 
&#8805;3 g of EMLA cream was applied; in one of these cases, the
infant was also 
receiving sulfamethoxadole.<SUP>47,48</SUP> EMLA cream should not
be used in 
neonates who are receiving other drugs known to induce
methemoglobinemia. <A 
name=DPNB>
<H4>Dorsal Penile Nerve Block (DPNB)</H4>

<P><A
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/williamson/">DPNB</A> is
very 
effective in reducing the behavioral and physiologic indicators
of pain caused 
by circumcision. Compared with control subjects who received no
analgesia, 
neonates with DPNB cry 45% to 76% less,<SUP>39,49-51</SUP> have
34% to 50% 
smaller increases in oxygen saturation during the
procedure.<SUP>39,52</SUP> 
Additionally, DPNB lidocaine attenuates the adrenocortical stress
response 
compared with control subjects who received no injections or
injections of 
saline.<SUP>49</SUP> The <A 
href="http://units.ox.ac.uk/departments/anaesthetics/wfsa/html/u0
2/u02_008.htm">technique</A> 
of Kirya and Werthman is used most commonly to perform the
block.<SUP>52</SUP> A 
27-guage needle is used to inject the 0.4 mL of 1% lidocaine to
be administered 
at both the 10- and 2- o'clock positions at the base of the
penis. The needle is 
directed posteromedially 3 to 5 mm on each side until Buck's
fascia is 
encountered. After aspiration, the local anesthetic is injected
Systemic 
lidocaine levels obtained with use of this technique demonstrated
peak 
concentrations at 60 minutes, well below toxic
ranges.<SUP>52</SUP> Several 
studies evaluating the efficacy of DPNB reported bruising as the
most frequent 
complication.<SUP>49,50,54,55</SUP> Hematomas were rarely seen
and caused no 
long-term injury.<SUP>50,56</SUP> A single report of penile
necrosis may have 
been secondary to the surgical technique rather than to the
DPNB.<SUP>37</SUP> 
<A name=ring>
<H4>Subcutaneous Ring Block</H4>

<P>A subcutaneous circumferential ring of 0.8 mL of 1% lidocaine
without 
epinephrine at the midshaft of the penis was found to be more
effective than 
EMLA cream or DPNB in a recent <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/lander/">study</A>.
<SUP>43 
</SUP>Although all treatment groups experienced an attenuated
pain response, the 
ring block appeared to prevent crying and increases in heart
rates more 
consistently than did EMLA cream or DPNB throughout all stages of
circumcision. 
In another <A
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/masciello/">study</A>, 
after a subcutaneous injection of lidocaine had been given at the
level of the 
corona, it was noted that fewer infants cried during the
dissection of the 
foreskin, placement of the bell, and clamping with the Gomco,
compared with 
those infants with a DPNB,<SUP>58</SUP> Additionally, the
cortisol response was 
diminished in the subcutaneous group compared with the DPNB
group.<SUP>58</SUP> 
No complications of this simple and highly effective technique
have been 
reported. 
<H4>Others</H4>Sucrose on a pacifier has been demonstrated to be
more effective 
than water for decreasing cries during circumcision.<SUP>59</SUP>
Acetominophen 
may provide <A
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/howard/">analgesia after 
the immediate postoperative period</A>.<SUP>60</SUP> Neither
technique is 
sufficient for the operative pain and cannot be recommended as
the sole method 
of analgesia. A more physiologic positioning of the infant in a
padded 
environment may decrease distress during the
procedure.<SUP>61</SUP> 

<P>In summary, analgesia is safe and effective in reducing the
procedural pain 
associated with circumcision, and, therefore, <A

HREF="http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/101/6/e5">
adequate analgesia should be 
provided</A> if neonatal circumcision is performed. EMLA cream,
DPNB, and a 
subcutaneous ring block may provide the most effective analgesia.

CIRCUMCISION STATUS AND UTI IN<BR>INFANT MALES</A></B> 

<P>There have been several studies published in the medical
literature over the 
past 15 years that address the association between circumcision
status and 
UTI.<SUP>62-68</SUP> Because the majority of UTI in males occur
during the first 
year of life, almost all the studies that examine the
relationship between UTI 
and circumcision focus on this period. All studies have shown an
increased risk 
of UTI in uncircumcised males, with the greatest risk in infants
younger than 1 
year of age. 

<P>Initial retrospective studies suggested that uncircumcised
males were 10 to 
20 times more likely to develop UTI than were circumcised male 
infants.<SUP>62</SUP> A review published in 1993 summarized the
data from nine 
studies and reported that uncircumcised males had a 12.0-fold
increased risk of 
UTI compared with circumcised infant males.<SUP>69 </SUP>More
recent studies 
using cohort and case-control design also support an association,
although 
reduced in magnitude.<SUP>63,64,67,70-72</SUP> These studies have
found a three 
to seven times increased risk of UTI in incircumcised male
infants compared with 
that in circumcised male infants. This consistent association was
found in 
samples from populations in which circumcision rates varied from
low 
(&lt;20%),<SUP> 67</SUP> to medium (45%),<SUP>72</SUP> to high 
(75%).<SUP>63,64</SUP> One of these, a population based cohort <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/to2/">study</A> of
58,000 Canadian 
infants, found that the hospital admission rate for UTI in infant
males younger 
than 1 year of age was 1.88 per 1000 in circumcised infants and
7.02 per 1000, 
for a relative risk of 3.7.<SUP> 72</SUP> 

<P>The proportion of male infants who have symptomatic UTI during
the first year 
of life is somewhat difficult to estimate because the rate varies
among studies. 
A study at an urban emergency department found that 2.5% of
febrile male infants 
&lt;60 days of age had UTI.<SUP>71</SUP> Data from Europe, based
on a largely 
uncircumcised population, report UTI rates of 1.2% for infant
boys.<SUP>73</SUP> 
The number is similar to the rates of 0.7% to 1.4% reported for
uncircumcised 
males in the United States and Canada.<SUP>73,74</SUP> In
comparison, UTI rates 
for circumcised males are reported to be 0.12% to 0.19% Although
these 
cross-cultural data do not provide information on specific
individual risk 
factors, the similarity of rates for uncircumcised male infants
support an 
association between circumcision status and UTI. Using these
rates and the 
increased risks suggested from the literature, one can estimate
that 7 to 14 of 
1000 uncircumcised male infants will develop a UTI during the
first year of 
life, compared with 1 to 2 of 1000 circumcised male infants. 

<P>Although all these studies have shown an increased risk of UTI
in 
uncircumcised male infants, it is difficult to summarize and
compare results 
because of differences in methodology, samples of infants
studied, determination 
of circumcision status, method of urine collection, UTI
definition, and 
assessment of confounding variables. Furthermore, in some
studies, methods for 
determining the reliability of the data were not described. 

<P>Few of the studies have evaluated the association between UTI
in male infants 
and circumcision status have looked at potential confounders
(such as 
prematurity, <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/pisacane/">
breastfeeding</A>, and 
method of urine collection) in a rigorous way. For example,
because premature 
infants appear to be at increased risk for UTI,<SUP>75-77</SUP>
the inclusion of 
hospitalized premature infants in a study population may act as a
confounder by 
suggesting an increased risk of UTI in uncircumcised infants.
Premature infants 
usually are not circumcised because of their fragile health
status.<SUP>78</SUP> 

<P>In another example, <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/pisacane1992/">
breastfeeding was 
shown to have a threefold protective effect on the incidence of
UTI in a sample 
of uncircumcised infants</A>. However, breastfeeding status has
not been 
evaluated sytematically in studies assessing UTI and circumcision 
status.<SUP>79</SUP> 

<P>One study suggested that the method used to obtain urine for
culture may 
influence the rate of infection,<SUP>64</SUP> with the greatest
risk for 
infection noted in uncircumcised male infants who had samples
taken by 
catherization, compared with those who had samples obtained by
catherization, 
compared with those who had samples obtained by suprapubic
aspiration. The three 
methods of urine collection in male infants (suprapubic
aspiration vs 
catheterization vs bag) vary significantly in their accuracy of
diagnosing UTI. 
Suprapubic aspiration is considered the "gold standard" but may
not be used in 
clinical practice for reasons of parent and physician preference
as well as for 
efficiency.<SUP>80,81</SUP> No studies addressing the association
between UTI 
and circumcision status have used suprapubic aspiration
exclusively; one study, 
however, did use suprapubic aspiration in 92% of urine
collections and noted a 
10-fold increased risk of UTI in uncircumcised male infants
compared with 
circumcised infants.<SUP>66</SUP> There are no studies comparing
urine obtained 
by supapubic aspiration and urethral catheterization in
uncircumcised males. In 
the only study comparing the accuracy of catheterization and
suprapubic 
aspiration in a sample of 35 asymtomatic boys (1 uncircumcised,
28 circumcised, 
and 6 with circumcision status not reported), the one
false-positive urine 
sample with significant bacterial growth was abtained by
catheterization of a 
1-year-old uncircumcised male. A study in newborns demonstrated
that urine 
sample obtained by bag technique is inadequate for diagnosing UTI
in an 
uncircumcised male because of the high false-positive rate
<SUP>82</SUP>, 
however, a negative bagged urinalysis and culture makes the
diagnosis of UTI 
unlikely. 

<P>There is a biologically plausible explanation for a
relationship between an 
intact foreskin and an increased association of UTI during
infancy. Increased 
periurethral bacterial colonization may be a risk factor for
UTI.<SUP>68</SUP> 
During the first 6 months of life, there are more uropathogenic
organisms around 
the urethral meatus of uncircumcised infants than around that of
circumcised 
male infants, but this decreases in both groups after the first 6 
months.<SUP>65</SUP> In addition, it was demonstrated in an
experimental 
preparation that uropathogenic bacteria adhered to and readily
colonized the 
mucosal surface of the foreskin, but did not adhere to the
keratinized surface 
of the foreskin.<SUP>70</SUP> 

<P><A
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/mccracken/">In
children</A>, 
UTI usually necessitates a physician visit and may involve the
possibility of an 
invasive procedure and hospitalization. Studies on the morbidity
and mortality 
associated with UTI in infancy have been confused by the
inclusion of high-risk 
neonates and those with congenital anomalies.<SUP>83,84</SUP> The
evidence that 
does exist suggests that the incidence of bacteremia associated
with UTI occurs 
primarily during the first six months of life and is inversely
related to 
age.<SUP>62-64,85</SUP>. Although the primary incidence of
bacteremia associated 
with UTI is 2% to 10% during the first 6 months of life, it has
been noted to be 
as high as 21% in the neonatal period. <SUP>83,86</SUP> 

<P>Symptomatic UTI in infancy is considered to be a marker for <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/mueller/">
congenital anomalies</A> 
of the genitourinary tract; however, not all infants who have UTI
will have 
abnormal radiologic findings. A published review suggests that
the majority of 
children with UTI will have normal radiographic examination 
results.<SUP>87</SUP> There is a lack of information on the
sequelae of UTI in 
infants with a normal genitourinary system. 

<P>There may be a relationship between young age at first
symptomatic UTI and 
subsequent renal scar formation.<SUP>88,89</SUP> Similarly, there
may be a 
relationship between young age (&#8804;3 years) at first
 episode of pyelonephritis and 
decreased glomerular filtration rate.<SUP>90</SUP> However,
 the relationship 
between renal scar formation and renal function is not well
defined, and the 
long-term clinical significance of renal scars remains to be
demonstrated. 

<P>Data for multiple studies suggest that uncircumcised male
infants are perhaps 
10 times more likely than are circumcised males to develop a UTI
in the first 
year of life. This means that an uncircumcised male has an
approximate 1 in 100 
chance of developing UTI during the first year of life; a
circumcised male 
infant has a 1 in 1000 chance of developing UTI during the first
year of life. 
Published date from a population-based cohort <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/to2/">study</A> of
58,000 Canadian 
infants suggests an increased risk of UTI in uncircumcised infant
males of lower 
magnitude than data from previous studies. Using data from this
study, an 
uncircumcised male infant has a 1 in 140 chance of being
hospitalized for a UTI 
during the first year of life; a circumcised male infant has an
approximate 1 in 
530 chance of being hospitalized for a UTI during the first year
of life. 

<P>In summary, all studies that have examined the association
between UTI and 
circumcision status show an increased risk of UTI in
uncircumcised males, with 
the greatest risk in infants younger than 1 year of age. The
magnitude of the 
effect varies among studies. Using numbers from the literature,
one can estimate 
that 7 to 14 of 1000 uncircumcised male infants will develop a
UTI during the 
first year of life, compared with 1 to 2 of 1000 circumcised male
infants. 
Although the relative risk of UTI in uncircumcised male infants
compared with 
circumcised male infants is increased from 4- to as much as
10-fold during the 
first year of life, the absolute risk of developing a UTI in an
uncircumcised 
male infant is low (at most, ~1%)

CIRCUMCISION STATUS AND CANCER<BR>OF THE PENIS</A></B> 

<P>Cancer of the penis is a rare disease; the annual age-adjusted
incidence of 
penile cancer is 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 males in the United
States.<SUP>91</SUP> 
In countries where the overwhelming majority of men are
uncircumcised, the rate 
of cancer varies from 0.82 per 100 000 in Denmark<SUP>92</SUP> to
2.9 to 6.8 per 
100 000 in Brazil<SUP>93</SUP> and 2.0 to 10.5 per 100 000 in 
India.<SUP>94</SUP> 

<P>The literature on the relationship between circumcision status
and risk of 
squamous cell carcinoma of the penis (SCCP) is difficult to
evaluate. Reports of 
several case series have noted a strong association with between
uncircumcised 
status and increased risk for penile cancer<SUP>95-97</SUP>;
however, there have 
been few rigorous hypothesis-testing investigations. SCCP exists
in both 
preinvasive (carcinoma in situ) and invasive forms.<SUP>98</SUP>
Precancerous 
SCCP lesions and in situ SCCP ofter occur primarily on the shaft
of the penis 
wheras invasive SCCP may be more likely to involve the glans. It
is unclear 
whether preinvasive and invasive forms of SCCP are separate
diseases or whether 
invasive SCCP develops from preinvasive SCCP.<SUP> 99</SUP> This
uncertainty 
makes analysing the literature difficult. Uncircumcised status
has been strongly 
associated with invasive SCCP in multiple case series. 

<P>The major risk factor for penile cancer across three
case-control studies was 
phimosis. Other <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/vanhowe/">risk
factors</A> 
include "previous genital condition," genital warts, &gt;30
sexual partners, and 
cigarette smoking.<SUP>100-102</SUP> Two of the studies were
conducted in areas 
of the world that do not practice neonatal circumcision. In the
third study, in 
which 45% of the men had been circumcised as neonates, the risk
of SCCP among 
men who were never circumcised was 3.2 times that of <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/vanhowe/">men
who had been 
circumcised at birth</A>. This study did not analyze in situ and
invasive SCCP 
separately. This study also used self-report to determine
circumcision status. 
Self-report may not be an accurate method of determining
circumcision 
status.<SUP>103</SUP> 

<P>The strength of the association between sexual behavior in the
development of 
penile cancer is unclear. Although there is an association of <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/mccance/">human
papilloma virus 
(HPV) DNA and genital warts with penile cancer</A>, the
percentage of penile 
cancers with HPV DNA is lower than that of four other anogenital
tumors (anus, 
cervix, vulva, vagina), implying that sexual transmission may be
less of a 
factor in the genesis of SCCP than of these other
cancers.<SUP>104</SUP> It may 
be that HPV is a co-factor for penile cancer, but that <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/harish/">other
conditions</A> 
also must be present for progression to malignancy. 

<P>Neonatal circumcision offers some protection from penile
cancer; however, 
<A href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/bissada1/">
circumcision at a 
later stage</A> does not seem to confer the same level of 
protection.<SUP>105</SUP> There is at least a three-fold
increased risk of 
penile cancer in uncircumcised men; phimosis, a condition that
exists only in 
uncircumcised men, increases the risk further.<SUP> 92,106</SUP>
The 
relationship among hygiene, phimosis, and penile cancer is
uncertain, although 
many hypothesize that <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/frisch/">
good hygiene prevents  phimosis and penile
cancer</A>.<SUP>93</SUP> 

<P>An annual penile cancer rate of 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000
translates to 9 to 10 
cases per year per 1 million men. Although the risk of developing
penile cancer 
in an uncircumcised man compared with a circumcised man is
increased more than 
three fold, it is difficult to estimate accurately the magnitude
of this risk 
based on existing studies, Nevertheless, in a developed country
such as the 
United States, penile cancer is a rare disease and the risk of
penile cancer 
developing in an uncircumcised man, although increased compared
with a 
circumcised man, is low.

HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV)</A></B> 

<P>Evidence regarding the relationship of circumcision to STD in
general is 
complex and conflicting.<SUP>13,109,110</SUP> Studies suggest
that circumcised

substantial body of 
evidence</A> that links non-circumcision in men with risk for HIV 
infection.<SUP>19,112-134</SUP> There does appear to be a
plausible biologic 
explanation for this association in that the mucous surface of
the uncircumcised 
penis allows for viral attachment to lymphoid cells at or near
the surface of 
the mucous membrane, as well as an increased likelihood of minor
abrasions 
resulting in increased HIV access to target tissues. However,
behavioral factors 
appear to be far more important than circumcision status.

<P align=center><B>
<A href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/">
ETHICAL ISSUES</A></B> 

<P>The practice of medicine has long respected an adult's right
to 
self-determination in health care decision-making. This principle
has been 
operationalized through the doctrine of informed consent. The
process of <A 
href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/">informed consent</A>
obligates the 
physician to explain any procedure or treatment and to enumerate
the risks, 
benefits, and alternatives for the patient to make an informed
choice. For 
infants and young children who lack the capacity to decide for
themselves, a 
surrogate, generally a parent must makes such
choices.<SUP>118</SUP> 

<P>Parents and physicians each have an <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/AAP/">ethical duty to
the child</A> to 
attempt to secure the child's best interest and
well-being.<SUP>119</SUP> 
However, it is often uncertain as to what is in the best interest
of any 
individual patient. In cases such as the decision to perform a
circumcision in 
the neonatal period when there are potential benefits and <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/">risks</A> and
the procedure is 
not essential to child's current well-being, it should be the
parents who 
determine what is in the best interest of the child. In the
pluralistic society 
of the United States in which parents are afforded wide authority
for 
determining what constitutes appropriate child-rearing and child
welfare, it is 
legitimate for the parents to take into account cultural, <A 
href="http://www.circumcision.org/spectator.htm">religious</A>,
and ethnic 
traditions, in addition to medical factors, when making this 
choice.<SUP>119</SUP> 

<P>Physicians counseling families concerning this decision should
assist the 
parents by explaining the <A 
href="http://www.nocirc.org/consent/form.html">potential benefits
and risks</A> 
and by ensuring that they understand that circumcision is an
elective procedure. 
Parents should not be <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/protection/">coerced by
medical 
professionals</A> to make this choice. 

<P><A name=summary>

<P align=center><B>SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</B> 

<P>Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical
benefits of 
newborn male circumcision; however these data are not sufficent
to recommend 
routine neonatal circumcision. In the case of circumcision; in
which there are 
potential benefits, yet the procedure is not essential to the
child's current 
well-being, parents should determine what is in the best interest
of the child. 
To make an informed choice, parents of all infants should be
given unbiased 
information and be provided the opportunity to discuss this
decision. Analgesia 
is safe and effective in reducing the procedural pain associated
with 
circumcision; therefore if a decision <I>for</I> circumcision is
made, <A 
href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/lander/">procedural
analgesia</A> should 
be provided. If circumcision is performed in the newborn period,
it should be 
done only on infants who are stable and healthy.
