The demonisation of the human male prepuce has been an
unscientific process, even though some research, on the
surface, might seem to support it. In the late
nineteenth century, when male circumcision came into
vogue in U.S. medicine, there was near universal
acceptance among American medical professionals that
circumcision was an effective treatment for such
"diseases" as masturbation, headache, insanity,
epilepsy, paralysis, strabismus, rectal prolapse,
hydrocephalus, and clubfoot.[1] Leading medical
journals published thousands of case reports
demonstrating these and other miraculous therapeutic
benefits from preputial amputation. The notion that
circumcision improves hygiene and prevents sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs) originated at the same time
in the context of the discourse over racial and moral
hygiene. The peculiar American phenomenon of mass
newborn (i.e. involuntary) circumcision is a product of
the Cold War era. U.S. doctors readily embraced the
concept of mass, involuntary circumcision just as they
had embraced involuntary sterilization and other
eugenic measures - practices rejected by almost all
other Western nations. Mass circumcision peaked in the
1970s, when almost 90% of male neonates in the U.S.
were circumcised. Since then, the rate has declined,
but circumcision industry spokesmen have added to the
list of diseases that circumcision allegedly prevents
and cures.

<P>Historically, the most common reason given for
circumcision has been that it prevents masturbation.
Today, the most common reason given is that it inhibits
the transmission of STDs, even though rigorously
controlled studies have consistently shown that
circumcised males are at greater risk for all major
STDs than males whose penises are
intact.[2][3][4][5][6] Circumcision advocates are now
claiming that circumcision prevents AIDS.

<P>A review of the scientific literature, however,
reveals that the actual effect of circumcision is the
destruction of the clinically-demonstrated hygienic and
immunological properties of the prepuce and intact
penis.

<P>The sphincter action of the preputial orifice
functions like a one-way valve, blocking the entry of
contaminants while allowing the passage of urine.[7][8]
Ectopic sebaceous glands concentrated near the frenulum
produce smegma.[9][10][11][12] This natural emollient
also contains prostatic and seminal secretions,
desquamated epithelial cells, and the mucin content of
the urethral glands of Littr.[13][14] It protects and
lubricates the glans and inner lamella of the prepuce,
facilitating erection, preputial eversion, and
penetration during sexual intercourse. 

<P>The inner prepuce contains apocrine glands,[15]
which secrete cathepsin B, lysozyme, chymotrypsin,
neutrophil elastase,[16] cytokine (a nonantibody
protein that generates an immune response on contact
with specific antigens),[17] and pheromones such as
androsterone.[18] Lysozyme, which is also found in
tears, human milk, and other body fluids, destroys
bacterial cell walls.

<P>The natural composition of preputial bacterial flora
is age-dependent and similar to that of the eyes,
mouth, skin, and female genitals.[19] Washing the
preputial sack was once thought to aid hygiene. Washing
a stallion's preputial sack with soap, however,
encourages the growth of pathogenic organisms.[20]
Washing the human prepuce with soap is a common cause
of balanoposthitis.[21]

<P>Fussell <I>et al</I> have claimed that the prepuce is
predisposed to colonization by pathogenic bacteria, but
they did not measure naturally occurring bacterial
flora in living cohorts with undisturbed preputial
microenvironments.[22] They measured bacterial rates in
dead, amputated, chemically-treated prepuces inoculated
with virulent strains of pathogenic bacteria -
conditions that represent no known biological or
behavioral reality.

<P>Animal experiments reveal that in the presence of
hydrogen peroxide and halide or pseudohalides, soluble
peroxidase in the prepuce has an antimicrobial
activity.[23] Plasma cells in the mucosal lining of the
bovine prepuce secrete immunoglobulin under the
epidermis that diffuses across the epidermis into the
preputial cavity. In response to pathogenic bacterial
infection, preputial plasma cells increase.[24]
Antibodies in breastmilk supplement genital mucosal
immunity in infants. Oligosaccharides in breastmilk are
ingested, then excreted in the urine, where they
prevent E coli from adhering to the urinary tract and
inner lining of the prepuce.[25] An 8-year prospective
study that controlled for genitourinary abnormalities
found no difference in the rate of upper urinary tract
infections between circumcised and intact boys.[26]

<P>There are no histological studies that validate the
claim that the sclerotic keratinization of the
epithelium of the surgically externalized, desiccated
glans penis, meatus, or scar of the circumcised penis
creates a barrier against infection. The higher rate of
STDs in circumcised males might well be the result of
the loss of preputial immunoprotective structures. The
loss of the protective, self-lubricating, mobile,
double-layered prepuce exposes the glans and meatus to
direct friction, abrasion, and trauma. Eyes without
eyelids would not be cleaner. Neither is a glans
without its prepuce. The surgically externalized and
unprotected glans and meatus of the circumcised penis
are constantly exposed to abrasion and dirt, making the
circumcised penis less hygienic.[27] The circumcised
penis is more prone to infection in the first years of
life than the intact penis.[28][29][30]

<P>The prepuce is a specific erogenous zone.[31] It
contains a rich, complex network of nerves and an
abundance of mucocutaneous endorgans sensitive to
motion, touch, temperature, and erogenous stimulation.
[32][33][34][35][36][37] Both the inner and outer folds
of the prepuce have a denser distribution of nerve
networks than the rest of penile skin.[38] The rich
innervation of the inner prepuce contrasts sharply with
the limited sensory investment of the glans penis,
which is characterized primarily by free nerve endings,
which feel only deep pressure and pain.[39] The
double-layered prepuce provides the skin necessary to
accommodate the expanded erect organ and to allow the
penile skin to slide freely, smoothly, and pleasurably
over the shaft and glans. One function of the prepuce
is to facilitate smooth, gentle movement between the
mucosal surfaces of the two partners during
intercourse. The prepuce enables the penis to slip in
and out of the vagina nonabrasively inside its own
sheath of self-lubricating, movable skin. The female is
thus stimulated by moving pressure rather than by
friction only, as when the male's prepuce is missing.

<P>Circumcision radically desensitizes the penis and
immobilizes whatever shaft skin remains.[40] The loss
of preputial mobility, primary sensory structures,
orgasm-triggering nerve endings, and the inevitable
desensitization of the glans may necessitate more
vigorous and prolonged thrusting to trigger orgasm. For
this reason, a circumcised penis may be more likely
than an intact penis to cause the breaks, tears,
micro-fissures, abrasions, and lacerations in a vagina
(or rectum) through which HIV in the thrusting
partner's semen could enter the receiving partner's
bloodstream.

<P>The prepuce is also richly vascular.[37] [41][42]
The most vascular parts of the body are those least
vulnerable to infection.

<P>These factors may explain why circumcised American
males are more likely than their genitally intact peers
to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors (such as anal
intercourse and active and passive homosexual oral sex)
that lead to HIV and other STD infections.[43]

<P>Epithelial Langerhans cells (ELCs), a component of
the immune system, help the body recognize and process
antigens, directing them to lymphocytes or macrophages.
Weiss <I>et al</I> noted an abundance of ELCs in the outer
surface of the neonatal prepuce comparable to the
general density of ELCs found in adult skin.[44] They
suggest that the relative paucity of ELCs in the inner
mucosal surface of the neonatal prepuce results in a
reduced immune response to cutaneous antigens and
recommend universal neonatal circumcision to prevent
HIV infection. This recommendation is untenable because
the prepuce of virtually all neonates is fused to the
glans, sealing the undeveloped preputial pouch from
external contact.[45][46] Furthermore, the newborn has
just emerged from a sterile environment, where no ELCs
are needed. There is no documentation of the comparable
density of ELC in the mucous membranes of the
surgically externalized glans penis, meatus, or the
circumcision scar of the sexually active adult.[47]

<P>Although a study of primates found that
Langerhans-like cells in the lamina propria, not the
epithelium, appeared to be infected with simian
immunodeficiency virus,[48] it is unclear whether this
observation can be extrapolated to the Langerhans cells
in the epithelium of the human prepuce. If Langerhans
cells are a factor, the ethical response would be to
promote the use of condoms, not excise normal tissue
laden with immunoprotective cells.

<P>It was an American circumciser in 1986 who first
hypothesized that circumcision prevents HIV
infection.[49] In an attempt to verify this theory,
others have published numerous epidemiological surveys,
conducted primarily in Africa. A review of these
surveys, however, does not support their assertion. Of
the 36 published studies examining the relation between
the circumcised penis and HIV infection, 15 found a
negative
correlation,[50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60
][61][62][63][64] 4 found a positive
correlation,[65][66][67][68] and 16 found no
statistically significant difference.[2]
[69][70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82
][83]

<P>The studies that find a positive correlation are all
population-based. Most of the negative association
studies are based on sexually transmitted disease
clinic data, have serious population bias, and must
therefore be viewed with caution. For example,
according to undisclosed criteria, Pepin <I>et al</I> counted
11% of their self-reported circumcised cohort as
intact.[70] Konde-Lule et al. assumed all Muslims were
circumcised,[77] an assumption that Urassa <I>et al</I> found
to be true in only 68% to 92% of cases.[64]

<P>Although circumcision proponents in the U.S. cite
these studies when debating routine
circumcision,[84][85] African data is not applicable to
developed nations.[86] Circumcision status in Africa
has an important but poorly understood cultural
significance that proponents of circumcision have
ignored. Circumcised and intact males lead very
different lives in the African regions investigated.
Marck has shown that intact males in circumcising areas
face severe discrimination in work, housing, marriage,
and sexual relations. A significant percentage resort
to prostitutes, increasing their risk of exposure to
STDs.[87] Ignoring these facts, some AIDS researchers
have recommended intervening into African cultures and
promoting circumcision in circumcision-free
regions.[88] Implementing this recommendation would
invite disaster. In many parts of Africa, circumcision
causes most tetanus infections.[89] The spread of
tuberculosis through circumcision in developing
countries is well documented.[90] The risk of severe
complications and death following circumcision rituals
in Africa is high.[91][92] The common use of dirty
instruments in group circumcisions only increases the
risk of HIV transmission.[93] Although the risk of
circumcision-related complications is higher in Africa
than the U.S., no level of risk is acceptable when a
healthy - and often protesting - "patient" has not
consented.

<P>In addition to its long-term immunological handicap,
neonatal circumcision immediately compromises the
immune system, making the circumcised male neonate
vulnerable to infection, often with tragic
consequences.[94][95] Even if the circumcisionists'
studies were valid, the real and unavoidable risks of
circumcision outweigh, both quantitatively and
ethically, the alleged risks of intact genitalia.
Amputation of the prepuce neither inhibits risky sexual
behavior nor confers immunity after exposure to
pathogens. This is demonstrated by the fact that the
U.S. has both the highest number of sexually active
circumcised males and the highest rates of genital
cancers, STDs, and AIDS of any first-world
nation.[96][97]

<P>Mass involuntary circumcision has failed to achieve
any of the public health benefits its advocates have
claimed for it; but even if it had achieved them all,
there can be no scientific or ethical justification for
depriving anyone of sovereignty over his own sex
organs. Neonatal circumcision violates bodily integrity
and imposes on an unconsenting individual a diminished
penis for life. In the wake of the Nuremberg trials, it
is inappropriate and unethical for doctors to persist
in performing or advocating involuntary penile
reduction surgery on healthy, normal individuals. The
totalitarian concept of involuntary prophylactic
surgery espoused by circumcision advocates has no place
in modern medicine or the civilized world. The key to
decreasing the transmission of STDs is education, not
amputation.
