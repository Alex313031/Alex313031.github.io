[I welcome all comments about this website, both positive and
negative. I would especially appreciate hearing from parents who
decided against circumcision and circumcisers who stopped
circumcising directly or indirectly as a result of visiting this 
site. The comments below were received in 1998. For comments
received in 1999,

<P>Powerful, graphic, moving. Thank you.

<P>My friend, you put this so well. Oh, that my parents had
thought
about this before they permitted me to be mutilated.

<P>Beautiful epitaph (if such a thing can be said about such
a subject). It was kind of strange. I think I've always wanted
an apology, but your site almost did it for me. I guess deep
down, it is important that someone <I>understand</I>. You
certainly do.
Unlike the doctors who snicker at us when we protest. In any
case, well done!

<P>Thanks for creating a powerful website.

<P>I just read through the section of your website titled 
<a href="iccah.htm">Infant Circumcision: Crime Against
Humanity</a>. I was electrified by its power. I think this
statement 
is one of the very best things I have ever read anywhere about
anything. 
Is there some way to put this statement somewhere else in your
website to
make sure that <I>no one</I> overlooks it?

<P>I really must congratulate you on a powerful and moving web
site. 
It's excellent! Powerful, emotional, and something every other
site has lacked: outright, unmitigated horror. I can't imagine
anyone 
visiting this site and not coming away seriously questioning what 
the hell is going on. I'm very glad <a href="sweet1.jpg"> 
Jacob Sweet</a> is featured and
I'm also glad you have <a href="quinn.jpg">
that child's [Quinn Ambriel Baker's] drawing</a>. 
You have delivered an arrow to the heart of any parent 
contemplating doing this to his or her 
child. It's magnificent. Thank you for an amazing and terrible,
but most sadly, necessary statement that the internet has lacked
until now. I hope beyond hope that everyone who visits your page
will
stop and learn.

<P>[The comment above] speaks for me too. I hope other eloquent
messages 
are sent to you for your **ESSENTIAL** Web page and for the other 
products, creations and powerful and insightful writings you have 
given us and the world.

<P>Magnificent.

<P>Took a quick look at your web site. Very nice. Lots of
information. Keep up the great work. [From an MD]

<P>Congratulations on the launch of your valuable new site!

<P>Superb!!!!! The opening dedication never fails to move me
deeply.

<P>Wow!!!! I just went to your site. Excellent. I liked your info
and the
many links. Some I have seen and of course they are all very
informative. 
I truly liked the lack of "gingerbread" at your site. Sometimes
people 
feel pressured into making a glitzzy looking site and loose track
of the 
original intent of getting the info out. Fit, form and function
go a long 
way.

<P>I just went to In Memory of the Sexually Mutilated Child.
Pretty much cried through most of it. Thanks for your work.

<P>I'm addicted to your website. I have <I>never</I> had such a
fascination
with any website before. There is something very different about
yours.
It contains the essence of the phrase "deeper into circumcision."
It
is about time that the world was allowed to read for itself what
only 
a few so far have dared to realize -- circumcision is a depravity
so 
deep and disturbing that it cannot be comprehended by the average
mind. 
It reminds me of the classic phrase Hannah Arendt used to
describe the 
process that led to and fueled the Holocaust -- "the banality of
evil."

<P>I just read that incredibly important piece 
<a href="serial-c.htm">The Serial Circumciser</a>. WHAT A
POWERFUL 
ITEM. I'm printing it out and handing it to people. I want them
to 
know these sorts of things. Thanks for sharing that!

<P>I love the simplicity & uncluttered appearance. Thanks.

<P>You and your website are to the American medical industry what
Woodward 
and Bernstein and the <I>Washington Post</I> were to the Nixon
Administration. You have uncovered and exposed this nation's
ugliest
secret. Bravo! I would welcome an expanded commentary on some of
the raw
data you present, especially in the section entitled
<a href="feelings.htm">"Feelings Too Violent to Describe."</a> It
cannot 
be overemphasized that the
American medical community, spokesmen for the circumcision
industry, and
others with vested interests in the perpetuation of circumcision
consistently push the limits of credulity by denying that anyone
objects to
having been circumcised. The truth, however, is that any
circumcised male
who raises any objections to what was done to him either against
his will,
without his consent, or without his fully informed consent, is
marginalized,
shamed, and silenced. Doctors diagnose and dismiss him as an
"isolated
case," a "psychotic," or an "anti-Semite" -- the ultimate
silencing weapon
these days. After silencing those who dare to speak the truth,
the American
medical industry steps up its damage control operations and
reassures the
public that only it can be trusted to be the legitimate spokesman
for the
American people regarding circumcision. This self-serving,
insidious
deception must be exposed. Your website gives voice to the actual
feelings 
of a brutalized and oppressed nation.

<P>Your webpage may well be the deathblow to circumcision. [From
an MD]

<P>I LOVE your webpage. I LOVE the heavy-duty stuff -- those
pieces you
and others create that make people <I>squirm</I> as they should,
squirming 
either because they are just beginning to understand circumcision
as the 
sexual perversion it <I>is</I> OR squirming because they are
mutilating
babies/boys, or defending or promoting this atrocity and fraud.
It is
important for others to see these other things that appear
nowhere else
on the Web. (And even if someone else did offer something like
this, 
that person would not have the truly powerful things you composed
and 
that others wrote and that you offer to the world to see, read
and
appreciate.)

<P>Your web site is the only outlet there is for the unvarnished
truth.

<P>You deserve the Nobel Peace Prize for your magnificent
tributary website.

<P>Congratulations on your website, and thanks for your continued
dedication and passion in speaking out to protect male infants.

<P>Wow... that's pretty intense! I'll make sure to add it to my
links when I update my site!

<P>Great information on your site. A stark reminder of the
horrors so many of us have had to face.

<P>I visited your site and was deeply moved. And I will be moved
even more when I revisit and revisit. I can't thank you enough.

<P>Good website. I saw the <a href="10000.htm"> 
$10,000 reward</a> posted for information on
a case 
where the victim is more crippled for life than intended. It is a
good 
start, but I wonder why they don't offer a reward for doing some
real 
revenge, perhaps a $10,000 reward for the arrest and conviction
of JAMES 
NESBITT, M.D., of THE CHILDREN'S CLINIC., who committed the
violent 
criminal assault and battery on the healthy normal child. Perhaps
a 
$10,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of any doctor guilty
of 
serial violent sexual abuse of children by genital mutilation. I,
for 
one, would offer to begin a fund with a $1,000 donation. Anyone
else 
willing to contribute to a "Save the Children from MGM -- Bring
criminal 
child abusing doctors to justice fund" can contact me. Zardoz

<P>I can barely write. I went to your site again. I'm in tears. I
went
there the other day when you announced it and I was in tears. I
am
forever indebted to the people on the Net who informed me so I
didn't 
hurt my baby boy. I don't have the words to describe my feelings
for 
the other poor children. Bless you. Bless you. Bless you. Now I
feel 
angry. May my anger turn to something more than screaming. I was
formerly 
ignorant beyond belief, but because of people like you I saved my
cousin's 
baby's foreskin, convinced them while she was in labor, hubby
wouldn't 
read the info! -- told every pregnant woman I had a
conversation with -- made whole dinner parties hear the story of
the 
foreskin and of the violation -- spoke up against my annoyed labor 
preparation class leader and told them all the class information
was 
wrong and to go to the web -- told every doctor/midwife I was in
contact 
with that I thought it was a violation of human rights and that
it is 
horrible to do that!

<P>I was reading misc.kids, when I saw a post about your web
page. I'm glad I did. I have subject lines with the word 
"circumcision" killfiled,
because I can't take the emotional stress that these discussions,
often
flame-wars, cause. I was circumcised as an infant, probably
because it was
recommended by the doctor, and because my father was circumcised.
I have been hurt forever. The material I have found, all on the
Internet, 
has stirred a great deal of emotion in me. Strongest among the
emotions 
is extreme anger, even fury. I should have been given the choice,
my 
parents should have known all the facts. This has to be stopped!
Doctors 
should be educated, and those who continue to recommend
circumcision 
should lose their licenses. I hope to have a wife, and one day
have 
children. I will <I>NEVER</I> let this happen to them, as long as
it's 
within my power to prevent it. It's barbaric, and I can't imagine
how 
it can still be sanctioned by the medical industry. It <I>is</I>
an 
industry. Too often profit governs decisions rather than the
patient's 
well-being. We need laws and lawsuits to stop this. 

<P>you are a sick man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<P>[Follow-up to the comment above] I am a nurse and I have 2
sons.
I have 
helped the Doctor in a few circumcisions, and my 2 boys are
circumcised. 
This is not sexually mutilating children. You do not know what
you are 
talking about. The decision to circumcise one's son is a personal
choice 
between the mother and father. Bigots like yourself should keep
your 
one-sided opinions to yourself. If mom and dad choose not to
circumcise 
their boy then good for them and if they do choose to do it then
good 
for them also. It is postings like yours that mislead people.
Everybody 
should keep open minds on all issues!!!

<P>I just revisited your site. The last two comments from the
denying 
ignorant were almost as shocking as the photographs. As long as I 
have been involved in children's advocacy it never ceases to
amaze 
me how children are belittled by the denying ignorant.

<P>I'd like to ask a logical question of the "Nurse" who appears
to be defending circumcision. If circumcision is
such
a "personal" choice, then why is the <i>person</i> who will be
affected by
the choice for his lifetime prevented from making "his personal
choice"? I can tell you why. Because his parents know that if
they
give him the choice, he would never choose the choice they are
making for him when they have him circumcised. I am crying right
now. 
How can I tell my 12-year-old son that I allowed him to be
permanently 
desensitized sexually because his father thought he would prefer
to "fit
in" and "look like all the boys in the locker room"? I
rationalized, "What
the hell do I know how boys feel? I'm a female." If I had the
choice to
make all over again -- knowing now how much sexual sensitivity is
lost
forever, not to mention physical protection from disease and
other
elements -- I'd tell my husband to go to hell. If the signatures of
BOTH
parents are required on the consent form, they'd NOT GET MINE!

<P>Great website. Keep telling it like it is.

<P>I'm the mother of a 2 1/2 year old boy and it never occurred
to me to
have him circumcised. I still visited your web site and looked at
the 
images in horror and read in horror. I mostly place the blame on
the 
doctors. I don't have to ask if it would hurt to cut away my
child's 
foreskin. Common sense tells me this would give him unbelievable
pain. 
I wish every new parent were forced to read your information, 
before allowing their child to be butchered. But people seem to
be doing 
what other people do, and it seems to be a normal procedure in
most 
hospitals (or else they would not ask you if you would like to
have it 
done). Parents should be more informed on that subject! I'm
looking at 
my son now and thinking "Thank God my motherly instinct told me
not to 
do such an awful thing to a little human being." 

<P>Your web site, and your book, are truly excellent. Shocking,
but
excellent. I thought I was numb to it all, after years of being
involved 
in this movement. No longer. I especially like the 
<a href="c-me.htm"> picture of the baby giving the finger</a>. 

<P>Your webpage is fantastic!

<P>Your webpage is epic. I have been methodically reading every
link for the 
last hour or so. When I got to <a href="does-c.htm"> 
"Does Male Circumcision Help
Spread AIDS?"</a> 
I started to get antsy as I always do around this topic, and
rehearsing 
in my mind how I would write to you about this page, when I got
to the 
end and saw your comment about Peter Duesberg and his book,
<I>Inventing
the AIDS Virus</I>. What glorious relief to find another person
who can 
see through the tattered AIDS story.

<P>Had I seen and known 17 years ago what I know now, I would
have stood 
guard over my son like a lioness protecting her cub; and I would
kill any 
circumciser who dared come wielding a knife to MY healthy newborn
baby son. 
Circumcision is another medical money-maker with the ugly twist
of sexual
predation. That's all. About 2,500 male babies in the U.S. every
day, and 
2,000 clitoridectomies a year on baby girls.  We don't know the
statistics 
yet on genital mutilations of adult women via episiotomy and
other 
so-called gynecological "repairs" because doctors falsify
records, 
but I <I>know</I> it's at least in the thousands, and I think
it's
probably
millions.

<P>I laserprinted the <a href="c-me.htm"> 
"Circumcise <I>me?</I>"</a> page, folded it,
placed it in 
an envelope, wrote the address in red ballpoint pen and mailed it
to my 
mutilator. Thanks for affording me the pleasure.

<P>Your site is the one I refer people to now. [From a Jewish
woman whose son is intact.] 

<P>Your website is an escape from the enslavement and control,
the 
cover-ups, and the lies and deception that keep people
afraid and keep them mutilating their sons.

<P>I was unable to read your website at one sitting -- it is so
powerful 
and moving. Thank you again for your unique contribution to the 
struggle against sexual mutilation. [From a Jewish woman whose
son is intact.]

<P>I truly feel your site is the best intactivism site on the
net.

<P>Your Website is important and unique. You have information
there that's available nowhere else.

<P>Your site is a blight on the circumcision racket. [From an MD]

<P>The medical literature about circumcision, as your 
<a href="compli.htm">Complications of Circumcision</a> 
page shows, is   
a horrifying, mind-numbing expos&#233; of total penis amputation, 
sex-change operations, gangrene, blood poisoning, heart failure, 
collapsed lungs, and 
severe burns. Why has this information been hidden from the 
general public? Why isn't it included on the circumcision consent 
forms doctors and hospitals give parents to sign? 

<P>As I read the story about the <a
href="jae-long.htm">circumcised 
Jewish man who needs intact Germans to humiliate him [Letter to
Parents Magazine</a>], I wondered if his mother would still have
had him circumcised if she had known about this possible result.
Circumcision affects the mind and sexual behavior in ways that
go beyond loss of nerve endings and penile sensation. Parents
should know that circumcision may condemn their child to a
degrading, secret existence in the sexual underworld. Most men 
whose circumcisions wired them for a life of sado-masochism 
probably came from loving homes. They probably had nurturing
parents. They probably did well in school. They may have wives
and children. They may hold good jobs. But they still have this
secret compulsion to commit or suffer atrocities related to their 
own circumcision's effect on their psyches. The warning 
"Buyer, beware" was never more apt than when dealing with someone 
willing to circumcise a baby.

<P>Thank you for turning over the rock of the American Medical
Industry and exposing the leeches and maggots lurking and
thriving there. 

<P>The
<a href="compli.htm">Complications of Circumcision</a> 
list is awesome. Thank you.

<P>I have sent copies of 
<a href="compli.htm">The Complications of Circumcision</a> 
to several doctors. [From an MD]

<P>I've lost count of the number of times I've visited your site.
I've 
spent countless hours there. I visited it again today. I finally
got to 
see and read everything. Sometimes I read the same pages many
times. 

<P>I forwarded 
<a href="compli.htm">The Complications of Circumcision</a> 
to Brian Morris
and Gerald Weiss [infant circumcision advocates].

<P>Your website is a marvelous addition to the circumcision
material available on the Internet.

<P>Your web site is the first I have seen besides travel agencies
so I can easily say it is the best I have ever seen!! Quinn's
drawing
at the beginning sets a tone which is carried throughout.

<P><a href="f4sale.htm">Foreskins For Sale</a> proves what I've
suspected all along: that a largely unrecognized and hidden
medical industry depends upon the continuation of routine 
circumcision.
How 
many parents are told that their child's foreskin will be sold to 
pharmaceutical companies and used in drug testing? How many
parents 
are told that their child's foreskin is worth money to a large
number of industries?

<P>Thanks for your web site for its widening lens into the
horrific picture of child abuse under the guise of a hygienic
ritual. [From a Jewish woman whose sons are intact.]

<P>Your web site (both quantity and quality) is becoming awesome.

<P>I just read everything on your web site again. It had been
about three
months since I last read it. It is the saddest work of art I have
ever
experienced. As before, the pain in my chest and the tears in my
eyes make
it difficult to finish. I used to think a marble sculpture of an
injured
child I once saw in a museum somewhere in Scandinavia was the
saddest
thing I had ever seen, but it cannot compare with your memorial.  
I cannot fathom the pain you must have felt assembling this site,
but I 
hope it is matched by a well deserved and equal amount of pride
in what 
you have given the world. Thank you for enriching my life.  

<P>Your website is almost too much. Thanks. If my parents had
known what 
you have told, I might not have been in therapy over the last 30
years.

<P>I read some of the "comments" last night. They are wonderful.
They 
personalize the whole experience of your site. 
<a href="deathblo.htm">Eileen Wayne's letter to Carla Miller 
["A Deathblow to Denial"]</a> 
brought me to tears. If I ever got in trouble, never mind  
hiring Johnny Cochran, I'd want Eileen to fight for me! Your site
really is without equal on the net. 

<P>I'm glad you feel it is important to let people know that some
doctors do oppose this madness. [From an MD]

<P>Some people had warned me that I should have had my son
circumcised because "there are a bunch of freaks out there who
get off on circumcising people, that they will try to get to my
son when
he's older & cut him," etc. etc. etc. Well, part of me thought
"No way,
they're just trying to scare me." The other part of me, the
Mother part, 
was like, well, I don't want to believe this is true. Now,
if what 
I've just read under the <a href="fetish-c.htm">Fetish
Circumcision</a> 
section of your site is true, I am really shocked, really grossed
out that people would do such a thing. It frightens me.

<P>I am so glad your site is out there. I showed it to my husband
-- the <a href="post1.htm">pictures of the babies being 
circumcised</a>. We both were like, Man,
I'm so glad we didn't put our son through that. 

<P>I have a favor to ask. I post on several circumcision debate
boards. Your
webpage is an indispensable resource. While I often refer people
to your
page, I thought it would be far more effective to paste parts
into my posts
once in awhile into the debate, as it's far less ignorable than a
link.
Would you mind?

<P>[No -- I wouldn't mind at all. That's what my site is for.
Please feel 
free to paste whatever you want anywhere you want to paste it.
"Talent borrows. Genius steals."]

<P>I recently revisited your site and realized that it may be the
best place for individuals to <I>get</I> it! [From an MD]

<P>Your website continues to grow and I have referred many
people to it. A great site. I still feel it is the best on 
the net. Many of the people I refer to it get back to me 
completely within the intact mindset.

<P>I am a new parent who regrettably "chose" to circumcise 
her son, by giving consideration to my husband wishes, due 
to being UNinformed by medical staff (OB-surgeon, Pediatrician, 
Maternity Nurses) and lack of supporting information. Your site 
truly removed any fear of the unknown. I feel this is a strong 
tool in persuading men to be in favor of leaving their sons
intact because you have removed the barrier to the unknown as 
well as replaced any negative images from 
<I>National Geographic</I>, etc. and poor x-rated shows. P.S.
Another 
excellent site for expecting parents is 
<a href="http://www.nocirc.org/">www.nocirc.org</a>.

<P>Your website is truly a work of art. Very moving indeed.

<P>I just found your circumcision website. Excellent! Seeing it
makes me regret even more that I lost my foreskin at birth.

<P>Yours is the Olympus of websites.

<P>Your site is the only one that makes me cry every time I read
anything on it. You have a way of stating your case that hits
a nerve every time, as someone recently said, "with cruel
clarity."

<P>If anyone reading this list [Restore-list, a foreskin 
restoration email discussion group] hasn't yet been to 
John A. Erickson's "In Memory of the Sexually Mutilated Child"
site, 
it's a trip you need to make. From the sites I had already
explored 
as a prospective, and now active, [foreskin] restorer and from a
few 
weeks on this list I thought I just about knew it all. But I am
reeling afresh from the 
<a href="post1.htm">
photographs of the infant circumcision</a>, 
stunned at the 
<a href="sight.htm">
descriptions by men circumcised as adults</a>, 
<a href="never.htm">
the words of mothers</a>, 
fathers and angry for myself and other men who have come to
realize 
what has been done to them. Explore this site when you have a
good few hours to spare. 

<P>I just read your <a href="special.htm"> 
"Special Announcement"</a> on your "In Memory of the Sexually
Mutilated
Child" web site. I cannot stop reading it. It may be the most
compelling 
piece of writing on the subject I have ever read. 

<P>What a lot of shit you talk. I am cut and do not know anything
else. [In response to "Special Announcement."]

<P>Interesting <a href="casey.htm">
drawing by Casey Miller</a>! I always said that the stories 
of alien abductions sounded a lot like what it might be like to
be circumcised.

<P>It would be interesting to know what prompted this child to
draw 
this picture. Is there anyway you can get a few words out of him 
for publication with the pic? 

<P>What an interesting drawing. Please tell us more about the
artist and how/why the piece was created.

<P>I came across your website through the newsgroup
alt.circumcision which I occasionally frequent. I am a web 
designer and have numerous websites of my
own, one of which is a professional dominatrix. I have seen many
nude men but very few uncut men up until a few years ago.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have only one daughter. 
If she had been a boy when she was born six years ago I would 
have circumcised her, not knowing anything about it. 
At 28 years of age (2 years ago) I had sex with the <I>first</I> 
uncircumcised man I had ever seen. 
I would prefer to never have sex with another circumcised man as 
long as I live. 
The difference in sensation is so different, I cannot even begin 
to describe it. 
<I>My</I> opinion is that circumcision should 
be outlawed except in these two cases: Medical necessity only 
after all other options have been exhausted; and after age 18 a
man 
should be able to do it himself after being counseled and
informed as to what he is giving up.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I see no other reason for circumcision. 
Uncircumcised penises in my opinion are beautiful, functional 
and a wonderful design. 
They seem to have more in common with female genitalia (labia 
seems similar to foreskin) and makes me feel closer to my
partner. 
We never require lubrication, and the sliding of the foreskin 
feels wonderful.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You may print my letter. I am glad to help.

<P>I think your Website is <I>the</I> most powerful tool
available for appealing to the emotions of parents. You
have achieved what I, from outside the realm of personal
experience, could only hope to achieve.

<P>I popped in to take a look at your site and ended up spending
over 3 hours there! It's a very good site in my opinion and
listed in my favorites so I can check for updates. I even printed
a few of the stories so friends can read them. Thanks for such an
informative and well done site.

<P>You seem like a very troubled person in need of serious help!
In other words you are a wacko and like 99% of this board
[alt.circumcision] need desperate help!

<P>Referring to circumcision as sexual mutilation insults and
hurts me deeply. I am <I>not</I> mutilated!

<P>I came across your website and could not sleep for days. I am
a Muslim living in India. I was circumcised at age 10 by a barber
and the memory of it refuses to go away. I congratulate you on
your superb website which serves as a beacon to all of us
circumcised and would be circumcisers that it's time we
questioned our own beliefs. I especially like the 
<a href="33.htm">33 Photographs of the Intact Adult Male
Foreskin</a>, my only regret being I cannot provide you with
a 34th photograph, as much as I would like to.

<P>I am a college educated woman. I majored in biology and took
anatomy courses. The function of the foreskin was never
discussed, only as a piece of extra skin. Pictures in my college
textbooks show a circumcised penis as the male anatomy. What a
lie! I always thought circumcision was good because it makes the
penis look nicer and keeps it cleaner. After reading all this
information, I cannot believe the propaganda I believed! I, a
biology student, someone who had studied the human body and  
(supposedly) knew all its functions! It is obvious that this
information needs to become common knowledge so we can stop the
sexual mutilations. Two nights in a row I have devoted to reading
all I could about the foreskin and circumcision. I am shocked,
crying. My husband is circumcised, and I had never before even
seen an intact male (being born in the 70's, the percentage of
boys being circumcised reaching 95%). I feel such a complete
loss, for my husband who has never known complete sexual
fulfillment, and for myself. We will 
never know sexual intercourse as it truly is meant to be. My
genitalia seem so different from my husband's, yet with a
foreskin, we would share a lot more similarities, and I know I
would feel closer to my husband. My husband needs firm manual
stimulation in order to achieve orgasm, and often does not enjoy
vaginal sex because I don't think it feels as good to him. Two 
out of three times, he will not reach orgasm and say "it just 
wouldn't happen." I don't exactly know what this means, but now 
I plan to be a lot more considerate of my husband's sexual needs, 
since I now know he will never enjoy an orgasm as I can. I am not 
sure if
I will ever be able to stop mourning our loss, I only know that
when my husband and I have children, if we are blessed with a
boy, we will <I>never</I> circumcise, and instead teach our son
about the gift he has been given.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on your letters page, one person
wrote about episiotomies sexually mutilating women. I have never
had a child and don't know anything about what can happen with
episiotomies. If you have any web pages to suggest for more info,
I would appreciate it. Please publish any or all of my letter,
anonymously.

<P>The <a href="mnnngr1.htm">posters of the babies being
circumcised and the woman with a knife at her throat</a> are
extremely powerful, so powerful that I
had a nightmare last night. If they have the same effect on 
everyone who sees them, I don't even know how to describe the
effect they had on me, it's just frightening and true. You hit
the nail right on the head.

<P>The angels have a special place in heaven for you! [From an
MD. I asked her if she meant "The angels in heaven have a special
place for <I>you</I>!" and she said no.]

<P>Your site's not timid, I'll tell you that. It's some of the
most "in-your-face" information about circumcision I've seen on
the Web. It's just there staring you in the face. There are no
two
ways about it: circumcision is sick. How can anyone come away
from your site with anything but the truth? It also has some
unique features, such as the 
<a href="fetish-c.htm">section on erotic circ fetishes</a> and 
<a href="febo.htm">"He didn't even cry" / Febo</a> 
-- a horrifying story. (It once got removed from a bulletin board
for being too graphic.) Your site is easy to get around in -- you
can scroll up or down to see what you want to click on and read
more about.    

<P>You are sick for saying a child is mutilated just because he's
circumcised.

<P>I agree with the person who said "The angels have a special
place in heaven for you." Those who call you sick and perverted
and berate your noble and inspiring work need to do some 
soul-searching for they seem to be in league with the Devil or 
even worse, they must be circumcisers!

<P>You <i>are</i> an angel!

<P>Thank you for helping me see the other side of this issue.

<P>The <a href="fetish-c.htm"> 
"Recreational/Erotic/Fetish Circumcision"</a> and
<a href="lampshad.htm">"Lampshades"</a>
pages on your website really shocked me.
I am at a complete loss to understand how anyone could want to
purchase these lampshades if they have ever experienced the
feeling of having an intact penis and understand the violent
circumcision which changes it forever. If I ever learn that my
foreskin still exists as part of a lampshade whose owner is some
sick pervert who likes to touch it and wonder how I felt having
it while I was intact and how I feel about having had it taken
from me, I would welcome the opportunity to tell him just how I
feel.

<P>I want to tell you how grateful I am to people like you who
are making people aware of the cruelty of this horrible
procedure. I am 16 years old and am not circumcised. I started
looking up this subject when questions like "Why do they
circumcise people anyway?" came into my head. It was very 
eye-opening to see what circumcision is really all about. 
All the power to you and your cause in the world.

<P>I greatly appreciate your work.

<P>The <a href="trk-ng.htm">photograph of the 6-year-old Muslim 
boy about to be circumcised</a> is one of the most disturbing 
images I have ever seen.

<P>Lawsuits! Lawsuits! Lawsuits! The <I>only</I> way to 
stop circumcisers is lawsuits! [From an MD]

<P>All the yucky details about weirdos and circumcision 
"clubs" give me the willies! I never would have imagined 
anything that strange existed. The thought 
had never entered my mind, for sure. Plus as a mom it 
makes me worried that some nutcase might one day target 
one of my kids because my sons are normal and they aren't. 

<P>Thank you so much for saying what needs to be said. 
I really admire what you are doing.

<P>Your <a href="jae-long.htm">
letter to <I>Parents Magazine</I></a> is not only epic but 
profound in its offer for a paradigm shift of mythic 
proportions.  

<P>[The following letter is reprinted in its entirety with
the author's permission.]

<P>I have decided to give your website, In Memory of the Sexually
Mutilated
Child, my AlternaMoms Award for November, 1998 in the category of
Best Site
in a Genre. This has been long overdue, in my opinion. Your
website is
partially to thank for our decision to leave our son Stephen (now
9 months
old) intact; it has also planted the idea of restoring his
foreskin in my
husband's mind. I have noticed that you do not display any awards
on your
site -- and I have a feeling that you have received more than just
mine. I
do not expect you to display my award -- but I will still link to
your site
on my awards page, which is at 
<a href="http://www.alternamoms.com/awardsgiven.html">
http://www.alternamoms.com/awardsgiven.html</a>.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This award to you is probably one of the most important I have
ever
given. I really feel that you deserve it. You are saving little
boys
from a needless procedure. Keep up the great work.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Again, congratulations on a job well done.

<br>Stephen's mama, Heather Kalisiak

<P>I referred two reporters to your site. Thanks for
putting together such a straightforward and informative site.
I have referred many people to it.

<P>Your site is now [10 Dec 98] the main leading topic in the
bulletin board discussion about circumcision at 
<a href="http://www.babycenter.com">
http://www.babycenter.com</a>. 
Your excellent site is doing a lot of good in my opinion.

<P><a href="little-b.htm">
"I'm going to cut your foreskin off, little boy"</a>
is stomach-turning not because it is true but because it forces
one to consider that this disturbed man may very well have been a 
pediatrician or obstetrician. What other career would
have been as attractive to him? It is a stain
on the medical profession that criminally psychotic perverts
can openly infiltrate it and act out fantasies like this 
and get paid to act them out as well.
Does this also explain why circumcisers prefer to circumcise
babies during off hours in sound-proof rooms closed off from 
the rest of the hospital? What better place for the circumpervert
to act out his fantasies on baby boys without fear of getting
caught?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most people are simply unaware of this sickening, darker side of
circumcision. The people of the United States and
the rest of the world must realize, for their own sake, that the
circumcision problem is not just a matter of scientific error,
misinformation, or greed; it is also, and perhaps more
fundamentally, a problem of criminal, psychosexual sadism. 
If it were just a problem of greed, doctors would have figured
out 
more lucrative ways to gouge clients.
If it were just a question of scientific error or misinformation,
circumcision would have been rejected in the U.S. just as it was
and continues to be rejected in Europe. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Something else has to be driving the circumcision mania of
doctors.
I think you have uncovered what that driving force is: predatory 
sexual sadism. 
Circumcision is not just the "rape of the phallus," it is the
rape of little boys.
Circumcisers are not doctors who have gone wrong. 
Circumcisers are sexual predators who have infiltrated the
medical profession. 
They are exactly like the child molesters who infiltrate the Boy 
Scouts. It is the same ruse. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No jail sentence could be too long for these knife-wielding
molesters who commit their grisly crimes against innocent
children. 
No electric chair could be too hot for these fiends, 
to send them back to the hell they came from.

"I'm going to cut your foreskin off, little boy"</a> 
totally gave me the creeps. [From an RN]

<P>I found 
<a href="little-b.htm">
"I'm going to cut your foreskin off, little boy"</a>
interesting and erotic.

<P>What a 
<a href="little-b.htm">
weird story ["I'm going to cut your foreskin off, 
little boy"]</a>.
$50 for 10 minutes equals $300.00 per hour.
I'd let someone be a freak with my foreskin for $200.00.

<P>It's 4 o'clock in the morning here in Norway now, but I'm 
too shocked to sleep. Have just visited your page about 
circumcision, and feel so upset about this crime. This is not 
common in Norway, I actually think it is forbidden, and this 
is the first time I have learned so much about it. Keep
up the good work.

<P>It seems you're becoming famous in a weird way, fighting
for sanity. I believe you've found your gift for this life.

<P>A newspaper reporter I gave some information to for an
article he's writing about circumcision was floored by your 
site!!!!

<P>I like your website very much! [From a pediatrician who
no longer recommends or performs circumcision]

<P>Sometimes I forget I'm circumcised, sometimes I want to forget 
it all and live my life as best I can. 
But when I read articles on your site or such, I can't close my
eyes.
When I really get conscious while reading or when I go into 
introspection or look at my penis with my eyes and mind open,
I can't close my eyes.
Reality always gets back to me one way or the other.
Circumcision is not normal, comprehensible or acceptable. 
Circumcision is an aberration and a crime.
I will never be whole.
