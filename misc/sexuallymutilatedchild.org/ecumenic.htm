In eternal memory of the people whose cosmic awe,
universal reverence, and divine passion encouraged them to
challenge the bloody trajectory of female and male genital
mutilation (i.e., circumcision, infibulation, excision, subincision,
incision, and the like), the collective sign and symbol of
humanity's contemporary state of self-degradation sealed by
incalculable mutilated, delicate clitorises, by innumerable
shredded, tender foreskins, and too often by complete, innocent
genitalia, a collective bloodbath, greater in count than the
fatalities of all historical holocausts.
<P>
In remembrance of the legion of victims of genital
crimes, the most atrocious of all violations against nature, the
greatest of all socially-sanctioned obscenities, accepted and
upheld as modern idolatry by lands crippled spiritually,
annihilating all visions of an holistic worldview.
<P>
In honor of the individuals boldly retraditioning popular
canons of female sexuality and promoting the radiating glory of
the complete, unblemished woman, of male sexuality and
advocating for the overpowering beauty and splendor of the
natural, intact man, and of human wholeness above reproach
and free of corruption.
<P>
And in hope of the ones yet born, defending,
preserving, and protecting the most endangered of all divine
deposits: the intellectual, physical, and spiritual elements of
humanity, of every molecule of creation, inclusive of each part
of the universe.
<P>
Through the cataclysmic cries and lives of billions of
children and adults, the universe begins to heal and regain its
most blessed and treasured state: a spiritual people, a humanity
of intellect in reason, of flesh in majesty, of spirit in sanctity:
one ecum&#233ne, one whole world, complete of all, integral for all.
<P>
Respecting all of the global concerns above, and
moved to immediate action, Ecumenics International, Inc. is
resolved by natural human necessity to progressive engagement
of promoting the abolishment of all forms of female and male
genital mutilation, of participating in the painful commemoration
of billions of victims, and of honoring most readily all martyrs
of human rights, justice, peace, and the integrity of the
ecum&#233ne.
