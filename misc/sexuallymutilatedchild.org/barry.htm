<h3>The Nurses of St. Vincent: Saying "No" to Circumcision</h3>
<P>
<b>By Barry Ellsworth</b>
<P>
A profile of the 25 nurses, conscientious objectors to circumcision, 
who stood up and refused to assist in neonatal circumcisions at St. 
Vincent Hospital, Santa Fe, New Mexico. 
<P>
<blockquote>
          "In 1992 three nurses at a New Mexico hospital
     informed doctors that they would no longer help
     circumcise baby boys. Within days they were joined by
     more than 20 of their co-workers, all of whom objected
     to circumcision on ethical grounds. I went to Santa Fe
     to find out why the nurses opposed circumcision. What
     had they seen behind the closed doors of the
     circumcision room? What did they know that parents
     didn't know? What could they tell me about an event
     that I bear the scar of, yet cannot remember?"
<P>
          "A fine film about an important subject."
      Margaret Lazarus, winner of the 1994 Academy Award for
     Best Documentary Short Film (Defending Our Lives)

          "After viewing this movie along with several
     others showing the actual circumcision procedure, it is
     my belief that circumcision needs to be looked at as
     sexual abuse of male infants."  Mary LeLoo, Publisher-
     Editor, Journey, Sept. 1994
