"The male foreskin has three important
physiological functions that circumcision irreversibly
destroys." (George Denniston, M.D., MPH, "Structure
and Function of Male and Female Genitalia; The
Circumcision Procedure: Risks vs. Benefits")

<P>"He [the newborn infant] does not need the
agonizing pain of having part of his body cut off for
non-existing health reasons. He does not need to be
circumcised for religious reasons or social customs or
superstition ... The newborn needs to be appreciated
for the amazing being he is and the care of his
foreskin should be: Do not hurt it! Do not try to
retract it! Do not amputate it!" (Paul Fleiss, M.D.,
MPH, "Care of the Intact Male")

<P>"The prepuce is much more complex than the
simple fold of skin described in textbooks. Its inner,
mucosal surface contains a tightly pleated zone, near
the tip, rich in nerve endings, particularly large
mucocutaneous end-organs that are also described in
the glans ... the prepuce is specialized junctional
tissue with a special sensory function." (John Taylor,
M.B., FASC, "The Prepuce: What, Exactly, Is
Removed by Circumcision?")

<P>"Epidemiologic studies of sexually transmitted
diseases (STD) and male circumcision are naturally
biased and confounded by unmeasured STD exposure,
which is tied to markers such as geographic, ethnic,
socio-economic and other risk factors." (D.W. Cameron,
M.D., FRCP, "Circumcision and Sexually Transmitted Diseases")

<P>"[A] carefully considered decision against
circumcision can be reconciled within Jewish
tradition." (Lisa Braver Moss, B.A., "The Jewish
Roots of Anti-Circumcision Arguments")

<P>"[T]the mistakes it [Judaism] carries with
it, such as the ritual of circumcision (Brit Milah),
should be considered no differently from the way they
are considered by society in general, no matter how
centrally important they seem to Jewish culture ...
Circumcision is child abuse." (Moshe Rothenberg, CSW,
"Ending Circumcision in the Jewish Community")

<P>"This presentation addresses the irrational
forces of religious and social customs that oppose
sexual pleasure and support the torture of children
(male and female) through the forced mutilation of
their genitals. Science attests to the incalculable pain,
injury and suffering needlessly inflicted upon children
through the dogma of irrational religious beliefs that
dictate forced genital mutilations. No religion has the
right to engage in torture, mutilation or human
sacrifice; yet all of these have been  justified through
religious beliefs ... the destruction of sexual passion
and pleasure is a common motive for genital mutilation
... Additional scientific evidence ... [of] a strong,
causal relationship between deprivation of physical
affectional relationships, including sexual
relationships ... and violent authoritarian cultural
behaviors ... A metamorphosis from a society that
values violence and pain to a society that values peace
and pleasure --  a society in which women are truly
equal to men -- is essential to the elimination of
genital mutilation of children and other forms of
human violence." (James W. Prescott, PhD, "Genital
Pain Vs. Genital Pleasure: Why the One and Not
the Other?")

<P>"In the last century, when medicine rose to
dominate childbirth in developed countries, it brought
with it a denial of infant pain based on ancient
prejudices and  scientific  dogmas that can no longer
be supported." (David W. Chamberlain, Ph.D., "Babies
Don't Feel Pain: A Century of Denial in Western
Medicine")

<P>"An infant does retain significant memory
traces of traumatic events. When a child is subjected
to unbearable, overwhelming pain, it conceptualizes the
mother as both participatory and responsible,
regardless of the mother's intent. When the mother is,
in fact, truly complicit, as in giving permission for
unanesthetized surgery (i.e., circumcision), the infant's
perception of her culpability and willingness to have
him harmed is fixed indelibly." (Rima Laibow, M.D.,
"Circumcision and Its Relationship to Attachment
Impairment")

<P>"Many circumcised men are angry and
resentful, feeling betrayed by parents and/or doctors."
(J. David Bigelow, Ph.D. and R. Wayne Griffiths, M.S.,
M.Ed., "Foreskin Restoration From Celsus to the
Present: Reasons, Techniques and Results")

<P>"Today, an estimated 98 million African
women are suffering the medical, social, and
psychological complications of genital mutilation."
(Asha Mahamud, M.D., MPH, "The Practice and
Politics of Female Genital Mutilation")

<P>"The medical and psychological consequences
suffered by its victims can be devastating and
lifelong." (Hanny Lightfoot-Klein, M.A., "Prisoners of
Ritual: Some Contemporary Developments in the
History of Female Genital Mutilation")

<P>"The human rights issues of informed choice,
body ownership, and the right to intact genitals as
feminist rights are evaluated in the context of the
recent feminist movement. America's women and their
health-care providers are challenged to extend those
same human rights, not only to females here and
abroad with whom they can identify, but to men, male
children, and male newborns, as well." (Donna Macris,
CNM, MSN, "America's Experience: The Feminist
Movement for Body Ownership is Medically Recognized")

<P>"Because of the subtle physiology of the
intact penis and foreskin and the physical damage
caused by circumcision, research is needed on
psychological damage resulting from male newborn
circumcision." (Frederick H. Baker, M.A., "Healing the
Trauma of Circumcision: A Call for Research and
Presentation of an Archetypal/Ritualistic
Therapy")

<P>"[C]ircumcision is a brutal ritual rooted in
superstition and should be abandoned." (Ashley
Montagu, Ph.D., D.Sc., "An Anthropologist Looks at
Circumcision and Its Probable Origin")
