<blockquote>
Most people in this country probably think of female genital
mutilation as something done to young girls in tribal Africa or
Muslim countries. But there are <I>millions</I> of women in the U.S.
today who have been genitally mutilated -- many <I>deliberately</I> -- 
by unnecessary hysterectomies[1], episiotomies[2] colporrhaphies[3],
and/or other needless or contraindicated surgery, including
clitoridectomies[4], but who remain silent because they 
think their loss of sexual sensation after childbirth is part of the 
price women normally pay for giving birth, because they feel too
humiliated to talk about it, because their husbands feel too
humiliated to <I>let</I> them talk about it, or because they are 
unaware that they have been mutilated. 
<P>
Entries addressing or directly related to this rarely acknowledged, 
vastly misunderstood, yet very common type of female genital 
mutilation are preceded by <small>"USA"</small>. 
<P>
See especially "My Own Nightmare and Fight for Justice" and "A
Deathblow to Denial," the letter from Eileen Wayne, MD, to Carla
Miller, later in this section.
<P>
[1] Total or partial surgical removal of the uterus.
<P>
[2] The cutting of the perineum to surgically enlarge the
vaginal opening. The most common unnecessary surgery performed in
the U.S. (followed by infant circumcision). The only surgery for
which there is no billing code and the only surgery for which
doctors routinely disregard the legal requirement for signed
informed consent. About 80% of women giving birth vaginally in
the U.S. have episiotomies.
<P>
[3] Removal of wedge section of the anterior and/or posterior
vaginal wall. May also remove the introitus and the wedge section
of tissue under the wedge section of vaginal tissue removed.
Surgical "repairs" that follow remove even more tissue.
<P>
[4] Removal of the clitoris.
