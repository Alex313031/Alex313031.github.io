<P>$9.95 plus $3 S/H ($7 outside U.S.) from NOCIRC, POB 2512, San Anselmo,

<P>[The only book I know of about circumcision by two medical doctors 
who state in the book that they themselves are intact.]

<ul>
"I am a general surgeon. The prime dictum in medicine is Thou shalt 
do no harm. The intent of this book is to explode the myth that routine
newborn circumcision does no harm." Thomas J. Ritter, MD

<P>"Dr. Ritter is a surgeon whose vehement objections to elective 
circumcision are influenced by his personal experiences both as an 
uncircumcised man and as a physician who has witnessed the trauma and 
occasional mishaps of this surgical alteration." Journal of the American 
Medical Association, 1/27/93

<P>"Dr. Ritter musters all the facts which show beyond equivocation 
how damaging, from every point of view and consideration, circumcision 
is. He shows beyond dispute how erroneous, and indeed, how damaging in 
their effects, are the medical claims for circumcision ... the best, 
and quite unanswerable case against circumcision that, to my knowledge, 
has ever been written." Ashley Montague, PhD
