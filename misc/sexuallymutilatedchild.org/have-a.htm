<blockquote>

Circumcised? Intact?

<P>Glad? Sorry?

<P>Why?

<P>How has being circumcised or intact affected your life?

<P>How do you feel about it?

<P>When -- and how -- did you first realize that part of your
penis had -- or had not been -- cut off? What was your reaction?
How did you feel about it then? How do you feel about it now?

<P>How do you feel about the person who circumcised you?

<P>How do you feel about your parents for having you
circumcised -- or keeping you intact?

<P>If you were circumcised as a baby -- even for "religious"
reasons -- would you rather that the person who circumcised you
had been stopped, by force if necessary?

<P>What, if anything, would you give to have your foreskin
intact, just as if you had never been circumcised, if that were
possible?

<P>What, for you, has been "the circumcision experience"?

<P>Circumcised as an adult? Better? Worse? How?

<P>If you are intact, would any amount of money induce you to
part with your foreskin -- and if so, how much? If not, why not?
What, for you, has been "the foreskin experience"?

<P>If someone had started to circumcise you when you were a
baby, even at your parents' request -- even for "religious"
reasons -- would you want him or her to have been stopped, by
force if necessary?

<P>Do you think that circumcision without consent of the
circumcised should be outlawed?

<P>What, if anything, do you think should be done about -- or
to -- those who cut off healthy foreskins of children and babies?

<P>What is the heaviest -- most extreme -- foreskin or
circumcision "thing" you ever experienced, witnessed, or heard
about?

<P>Do you have any thoughts about why anyone would want to cut
off a baby's (or anyone else's) foreskin or why anyone would want
a baby's (or anyone else's) foreskin cut off?

<P>Is there something deep in your heart you want to express?

<P>If you are a woman, what are your thoughts and feelings
about -- your experience with -- the male foreskin, male
circumcision, and/or female genital mutilation?

<P>Please respond freely, in detail. Heavy,
"unprintable," anonymous OK. Confidentiality respected
absolutely. All responses welcome, appreciated.

<P>Responses will be added to this website -- but only with your 
permission -- anonymously (unless you specify otherwise) in the 
hope that they stimulate further inquiry and encourage and empower 
others to speak up as well.
