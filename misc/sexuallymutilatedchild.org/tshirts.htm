This is a selection of T-shirts and bumper stickers -- some
actual, some still just ideas -- from a much longer list, compiled from 
various sources, in <I>Deeper Into Circumcision: An Invitation 
to Awareness</I>. No baby or child having his foreskin cut off has
ever found any of them politically incorrect, in poor taste, or
offensive.

Across the entire front (and possibly the back):

A CIRCUMCISER DAMAGED MY SON

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Aren't you glad you're intact?
<br>Don't you wish everyone was?

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Baby boys are attached to their foreskins.

Circumcised Dads of Intact Sons

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Circumcisers are a pain in the penis.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Circumcisers cripple lives.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Circumci$er$ have that l@@k in their eye$.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Circumcision forever deprives a 
<br>male of the use of his foreskin.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

CIRCUMCISION IS A CRIME
<br>KEEP CHILDREN INTACT

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

CIRCUMCISION IS A PHALLUSY

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

CIRCUMCISION IS BABY RAPE

<BR><BR><BR><BR>

Circumcision is iatrogenic 
<br>sexual mutilation.
<br>Boycott doctors who cut up boys!

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Circumcision is prepuceterous

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Circumcision is a sexual act
<br>of surgical sadism

[I dedicate the following T-shirt idea to Howard Stern, the
first mega-celebrity to take an appropriately outraged,
uncompromising, zero-tolerance stand against circumcising 
children and babies.]
