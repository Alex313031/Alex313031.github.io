<b>To the Canadian Medical Association Journal</b> (printed
9/15/82):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The best reason to leave a baby's foreskin intact is
that it's almost a certainty he will be glad you did.

<P><b>To the American Academy of Pediatrics</b> (8/30/83):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Please tell me what it would take to impel the
American Academy of Pediatrics to issue a statement
affirming the thoroughly documented but apparently
little-known fact that the foreskin is a normal, sensitive,
functional part of the human body, and recommending
positively, therefore, that the foreskins of babies
routinely be left intact.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[No answer received. Similar letters sent Feb. 6, 1985 to
Surgeon General Koop, the American Medical Association, and
the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. No
answers received. In 1984 the American Academy of Pediatrics
issued a pamphlet, <I>Care of the Uncircumcised Penis</I>, which
contained a paragraph under the heading, "The Function of
the Foreskin," which states: "The foreskin shields the
glans; with circumcision this protection is lost ... The
foreskin protects the glans throughout life." That paragraph
was omitted without explanation from subsequent printings.]

<P><B>To James E. Strain, MD, President, American Academy of
Pediatrics</B> (9/5/84):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a question I would like to ask the American
Academy of Pediatrics.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That the foreskin is a normal, sensitive, functional
part of the human body is a thoroughly documented fact.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Report of the Ad Hoc Task Force on Circumcision</I>,
issued by the Academy in 1975, states: "there are no valid
medical indications for circumcision in the neonatal
period ... circumcision of the male neonate cannot be
considered an essential component of adequate total health
care."

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Care of the Uncircumcised Penis</I>, issued by the Academy
in 1984, acknowledges one of the foreskin's functions with
the statement, "The foreskin shields the glans; with
circumcision this protection is lost ... The foreskin
protects the glans throughout life."

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My question is this: If a healthy, sensitive, normal,
functional part of a baby's body that shields and protects
the glans of his penis and that there is no valid medical
reason to cut off, is cut off anyway, hasn't that baby, from
a purely medical viewpoint, been harmed -- even if he never
realizes it?

<P><b>To James E. Strain, MD, President, American Academy of
Pediatrics</b> (2/4/85):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you for your note responding to my October 22
letter asking if depriving a baby of his foreskin doesn't
harm him even if he never realizes it.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You state: "With so many major problems in the world
today, I can't get overly excited about the circumcision
issue."

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I can only wonder what problem in the world you would
find most pressing if, like more a million babies in this
country every year, you suddenly found yourself strapped
down by someone cutting part of your penis off.

<P><b>To The Johannesburg Star</b> (9/17/86):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A recent issue of <B>The Star</b> reports that an estimated
3,000 men and boys in Venda were abducted and circumcised by
force.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Only 3,000?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the United States more than 3,000 <i>babies</i> are
circumcised by force <i>every day</I>.

<P><B>To The Sun Herald</b>, Biloxi, Mississippi (printed 12/1/87):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What's the point of The Sun Herald's October 7
headline, "Uncircumcised men face greater AIDS risk"?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Couldn't the same be said about men who are
uncastrated?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rather than have a healthy, sensitive, normally
functioning part of your -- or your baby's -- penis cut off,
wouldn't it be safer, surer and saner just to avoid contact
with the virus?

<P><B>To The Sun Herald, Biloxi, Mississippi</b> (8/29/88):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is the risk of catching AIDS from an infected partner
in Nairobi also higher for uncircumcised <I>women</I>? ("Risk
higher for uncircumcised," August 7)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The greatest risk an uncircumcised male faces in a
society in which most males have been circumcised, is having
a healthy, normally functioning part of his penis cut off
when he's too young to protect himself -- by a male who had
the same done to <I>him</I> when <I>he</I> was too young to protect
<I>himself</I>.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The fallacy of the circumcision mystique is that the
foreskin -- a uniquely specialized, uniquely sensitive,
uniquely functional organ of touch -- is denigrated as
abnormal, dangerous, and harmful; and circumcision -- which
literally censors a male's life by irreversibly destroying
that organ -- is extolled as normal, safe, and beneficial.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One can only wonder about the effects of such a
misrepresentation over several generations on an entire
nation -- much less on a single human life.

<P><B>To The New York Times</B> ("Studies Support Benefits of
Circumcision," Letters, 2/29/88) (3/31/88):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Benefits"?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If someone restrains you -- at any age -- against your
will, ignores your screams, and -- with or without an
anesthetic -- cuts, tears, crushes, or burns healthy,
sensitive, normally functioning tissue -- living flesh --
from your genitals without your consent-- consent not one
person in a hundred with the choice is, would be, or ever
has been willing to give -- how are you benefitted?

<P><B>To the American Cancer Society</B> (5/1/87):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Can you tell me if it's true, as I recently heard,
that one of the sources of the interferon used in cancer
research in this country is the foreskins of circumcised
human babies?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[A few days after mailing this letter I received a phone
call from John Stevens at the American Cancer Society, who
told me that the answer to my question was yes.]

<P><B>To The San Francisco Examiner</B> (12/14/88):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If a circumciser circumcises an adult with the adult's
consent, that's one thing -- at least an adult has a choice
and a chance. But to circumcise a <i>baby</I>, <I>knowing</I> that 
theonly reason he can circumcise the baby is that the person
he's circumcising <I>is</I> a baby -- that, surely, is the
ultimate perversion, child sexual abuse in its most vicious,
most degenerate form.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yes -- of course -- anyone who commits such an act is
sick and needs help. But doesn't he first need to be stopped?
