<h2>Call It What It Is: Child Abuse</h2>

<br>

<h3>By Gary L. Harryman</h3></center>

<br>

Cutting off parts of an infant's genitalia without a compelling medical
reason is sexual child abuse.  Therefore, after over 20 years of embarrassed
debate, lawmakers in California and Washington DC have recently passed laws
making the genital mutilation of female humans under the age of 18 a felony. 
<P>
     Our lumpen lawmakers should reread the equal protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment of our Constitution.  Because, without any rational basis
for this blatant gender discrimination, male American babies continue to
routinely suffer from needless amputation of parts of their penises at birth
with still no legal protection from their torturers.  
<P>
     Whether done by a delivery room doctor or a religious practitioner, such
as a Moil, medically unnecessary circumcision of minors, male or female, is
nothing more or less than a traditional sounding euphemism for
institutionalized child sexual abuse and is a clear violation of fundamental
human rights.  Those who argue "male circumcision is not as bad as female
circumcision" need to understand the issue is not severity.  The issue is
sovereignty.
<P>
     Circumcision is medically unjustified penis reduction surgery.  It is a
cure for nothing, and it is needlessly cruel; anesthetics are almost never
used.  Among western industrialized nations America stands alone in continuing
this primitive ritualistic practice of genital mutilation.  Europeans consider
it barbaric.  It is forced radical surgery, without consent, on a helpless
little victim.  It is an excruciatingly painful and crippling partial
amputation of the infants penis which frequently results in immediate and
serious complications and always results in permanent disfigurement and long
term physical and emotional debilitation and suffering.  Worldwide hundreds of
babies die annually in terror from shock and from infections or loss of blood
resulting from this senseless barbarity.
<P>
     For instance, last year in Eastern Cape, a small province in South
Africa, there were 34 deaths, 12 penis mutilations requiring plastic and
reconstructive or gender-switching surgery, and 743 patients admitted to
hospitals with septic wounds - all from botched circumcisions.  We don't know
for sure how many children die each year in the U.S. from botched
circumcisions.  Marilyn Milos of the National Organization of Circumcision
Information Resource Centers (NOCIRC) said she thinks "between 2 and 200 plus
infants die each year in the U.S.  Most bleed to death and are not reported as
deaths from circumcision."  Last year only six were listed as official,
because circumcision deaths are routinely covered up by the collusion of all
parties involved - including the parents.
<P>
     As a matter of perspective, last year just two weeks after news reports
that six children had died in the U.S. due to air-bag trauma there were
congressional hearings on whether air-bags should be outlawed.  (Never mind
that approximately 1600 adult lives were saved by air-bags last year or that
it is illegal to have kids in car seats in the front seat facing forward.)
But let the same or greater number of kids die at the hands of masked surgeons
performing a ridiculous ancient tribal mutilation and the silence is
deafening.  (Never mind that not one life has ever been saved by this
operation.)
<P>
     Just like female circumcision, male circumcision is both a sadistic
attempt to diminish youthful sexuality and an anachronistic tribal marking
ritual.  It should be criminalized and punishable by long term imprisonment
and, for the savages who financially profit from abusing infants in this way,
the medical doctors, loss of license to practice medicine for life.  It is a
malicious and unjustifiable violation of a physician's Hippocratic oath -
which is to "do no harm".  As Doctor Robert S. Van Howe, MD, FAAP, recently said
at a gathering of fellow Pediatricians - "It is a procedure desperately
looking for an indication".  Yet most in the American medical profession still
view circumcision almost as a cosmetic sacrament, not to be discussed
rationally.  There seems to be a powerful need on the part of doctors who were
circumcised either to bow to peer pressure or perhaps to get revenge and
"pass on the pain".  Could this be the genesis of our society's love affair
with mindless violence?
<P>
     What we flippantly call "the foreskin" is in actuality a complex system
of four anatomically distinct parts.  Each has a specific role in the full and
healthy functioning of the human penis, an organ that isn't even completely
developed until several years after birth when the synechia naturally detaches
itself from the foreskin and glans.  
<P>
     For a hundred years the scientific facts have shown circumcision to be an
unmitigated fraud.  According to conclusions in a recent research abstract of
"Circumcision In The United States", a study of the evidence done by Edward
Laumann, PhD. et al at the University of Chicago, "circumcision provides no
discernible benefit" and "circumcision may in fact increase the likelihood of
sexually transmitted disease (STD) contraction".  Circumcised American males
have the highest incidence of STD's in the western world.   The researchers
did find, however, that circumcised men masturbated more and were more likely to engage in oral and anal sex.  An ironic finding given that circumcision was once touted to prevent the "evil of masturbation."  
<P>
     Tim Hammond, of the National Organization to Halt the Abuse and Routine
Mutilation of Males (NOHARMM), says that males that have been circumcised as
adults universally report an approximately 40% loss in sensitivity.  The
obvious conclusion would seem to be that the two facts are affiliated.
Hammond explains that "amputating the human foreskin externalizes the glans,
leaving its moist mucosal surface unprotected and subject to drying out and
keratinization, which leads to decreased sensitivity (and therefore to)
behaviors offering more stimulation than vaginal intercourse."  Although non-surgical restoration is possible, it is a slow process and can never replace the estimated 20,000 specialized nerve endings that were lost nor the frenar band.
<P>
     Given today's huge body of evidence and scientific knowledge on this
issue there is no longer any reason for doctors to be ignorant of the facts.
Any doctor who performs this mutilation at this point in time is not a
scientist and not a healer but might fairly be called a witch doctor or even a psychopath.  Strong language?  Consider this: if a sadistic child molester cut
off part of an infant's body with his pocket knife just to hear that baby
scream he would be considered a monster.  But in fact he would cause no more
pain and suffering and ultimately do no more harm than a Harvard Medical
School graduate does when he uses his skill with a scalpel to surgically
mutilate a baby's penis.  Remember neither the child molester or the doctor
use anesthesia in their "procedures".  So-called medical doctors for scores of years have stubbornly maintained the wanton myth that "a newborn baby's
nervous system is undeveloped and he cannot feel pain."  
<P>
     John M. Foley, MD describes his observations:  "The circumcision of a
newborn boy is a spectacle so appalling and revolting in its cruelty that, on
their first encounter with the ordeal, many robust medical students faint.
The infant's arms and legs are tied down securely spread-eagled onto a molded
Circumstraint Board, with his genitals exposed.  The foreskin opening in a
newborn is normally very small, to prevent entry of foreign matter.  The first
stage of circumcision is to grasp the foreskin with forceps and widen this
opening.  Since the foreskin is attached to the glans by a still developing
membrane called the synechia this requires the foreskin and synechia to be
torn apart.  Naturally this is excruciatingly painful and the infant screams
in terror and pain.  Next, ignoring the infant's trauma, forceps are used to
pull the entire foreskin and much of the penile shaft skin through a clamp,
the clamp's screw is tightened and left in place for several minutes for crush to take place.  The tissue is then slit and trimmed with a scalpel.  From 50%
to as much as 80% of the total penile skin is removed.  In this country
anesthetics are rarely used, they are considered unnecessary.  The infant
frantically struggles and screams and often vomits and defecates, before
lapsing into unconsciousness."  From which some never recover.  The doctor
then bills from $150.00 to $500.00 for his abnormalizing accomplishment.
Medicaid pays $150.00.  Circumcision and the commercial selling of foreskins
is a lucrative billion dollar a year industry in the U.S.  Several American
companies use processed foreskins to manufacture medical products.
<P>
     A minor "routine procedure"?  Tell that to the Minnesota family whose new born baby boy was "routinely" circumcised last year by their family physician
and, in shock from the pain, never took another breath and died unnoticed by
the offending "doctor".  Or tell it to British Gaines of Austin Texas who just buried her one-week-old son, Jeremie.  During the circumcision "procedure" at Texas Children's Hospital mortally traumatized Jeremie stopped breathing, his
heart then stopped, he went into a coma and died.  Or tell it to Stacy Stroble
whose son Allen Ervin died after 6 years in a coma.  Little Allen was brain
damaged from oxygen deprivation during a "routine circumcision".  According to Paul Fleiss, MD, MPH, in the Winter 1997 issue of Mothering magazine,
"circumcision shatters the bond of trust" between mother and child and it is
not uncommon for "circumcised babies to withdraw into a kind of semi-coma that lasts for days or even weeks."
<P>
     Factually speaking, circumcision is medical quackery, a scientific hoax, and a barbarous violation of human rights.  Religious dogma aside, the
psychosexual pathology of why this horrible practice persists in so-called
civilized communities is probably encoded in the genes of aggression and in
the perversion of sadism not unknown among medical doctors.  Scientifically
speaking, it is clear that the notion that the human male is an "inferior
design" - the only mammal in creation born with a congenital deformity that
needs immediate surgical amputation - turns evolution on its head.  One only
needs to see the shocked reaction on someone's face when it is recommended
that they have their dog or horse circumcised to understand just how absurd
the whole business is.  The foreskin system, which makes up the only movable
part of the human penis, is no more a "mistake of nature" than are human
eyelids or ears and it should be left alone.  
<P>
     Parents and doctors should protect infants from harm and keep their
bodies intact.  The sovereignty of all human babies should be respected.
<P>
     If parents and doctors cannot be trusted to protect babies from
mutilation, then the law must.  Congress must insure that doctors and others
honor this basic human right.  As they have done to protect female babies,
Congress should immediately pass an equal protection law making the mutilation of any baby, male or female, a felony.

<h2>"It Ain't Broke - Leave It Alone"</h2>

<h3>By Gary Harryman</h3>

</center>

<P>
<br>
In the months since Lee Montgomery, the editor of <I>The Messenger</i> had 
the
probity and the guts to publish my article "Call It What It Is - Child
Abuse" (12/18/97) I have spoken with dozens of men and women who responded
to the issue.  Lee was as shocked as I that <I>The Messenger</I> received 
more
Letters to the Editor regarding this article than any other they have ever
published. Only two were critical.  Several people called me at work or at
home.  Others stopped me at the Post Office, Froggies, and the Fernwood
Market.  While getting my morning shot of caf&#233; au lait at Mimosa recently a
group of four mothers cornered me and enthusiastically volunteered their
stories.  Some of their comments were frankly heartbreaking.  "When my baby
screamed I tried to get the doctor to stop.  I ran into the room and shouted
and kicked him.  The nurses grabbed me and held me back.  He refused to
stop.  I cried for days afterward.  I was so young and naive.  It's been
twenty years and I still feel the guilt and pain."
<P>
     Every scientific article I've read confirms that every "medical" excuse
for routine circumcision, such as hygiene, is a myth.  Simply put, medical
circumcision is a hoax.  The most compelling indictment of the current
medical practice is a medical randomized control trial comparing the use of
anesthetics in neonatal circumcision reported in the December 24/31, 1997
issue of JAMA.  The study was halted midway because the doctors clearly saw
from the scientific evidence that they were in fact  "torturing" infants in
the control group, which did not receive anesthetic.  They also found that
some anesthetics simply  "were not effective during foreskin separation and
incision" as evidenced by  "increased heart rate and high-pitched screams."
Intelligent guys these medical doctors.  But it's now official; infants feel
pain!
<P>
     Since reading the printed views of a Biomedical/Legal Ethicist, Law
Professor Margaret A. Somerville, and from subsequent personal communication
with her I have become even more convinced that she is right - "routine
medically unjustified circumcision, performed on non-consenting male or
female minors, is technically criminal assault."  If done to a female it now
is prosecuted and punished as a felony.  Because of the seriousness of the
crime and its life-long negative effects on the victim, male circumcision
should also be classified a felony.  
<P>
     As with rape, circumcision involves the sex organs, but it's really
about domination, control, humiliation, and violence.  It's where sex and violence
first meet, and adults do it to infants!  Sex, like art and music, is a form
of non-verbal communication.  Why would any parent want to cripple their
child's ability to thrive and enjoy life and express himself as a unique
human being?  The words of Dr. Fleiss keep haunting me - "Circumcision
shatters the bond of trust between mother and child."
<P>
     Surgically crippling a child because "chicks dig it" (Letters to the
Editor 2/28/98) doesn't make it right either. In Somalia little girls have
their clitorises, clitoral hood (foreskin), and entire labia cut off, but
you probably won't find any men there who understand why Americans are
horrified about female circumcision.  After all, the Somali "guys dig it"
that way. 
<P>
     I also need to respond to the Jewish male (Letters 1/15/98) who thought
I was "Chicken Little" for criticizing his honorable ancient practice of human
blood sacrifice - a "Covenant with Abraham" of the Torah (Old Testament).
Isn't this the same book that says "A woman who is not a virgin on her
wedding night shall be killed" - Deu. 22:13. Or "A disobedient son shall
be stoned to death"- Deu. 21:18.  And that says all sex is dirty - Lev.
15:16 and "A woman is unclean during her period and everything she touches
is made unclean and she must sacrifice two pigeons to atone for her
uncleanness" - Lev. 15:25?  Or the one that reports the foreskins of
cadavers were once used as a dowry - 1st Sam. 18:25&27.  As part of that
"Covenant" in Genesis 17:23 God also instructed Abraham to circumcise his
non-Jewish slaves.  Does this mean all American Jews should still circumcise
their slaves?  Let's put the Old Testament to rest and leave our male
children with complete bodies and whole sex lives.  If, as consenting
adults, they choose to dismember their body parts to confirm their faith,
that's their business.
<P>
     Greedy doctors still make a lot of money performing this medically
contraindicated surgical hoax in violation of all seven principles of their
own code of ethics.  Perhaps its time their malpractice insurance companies
should refuse to cover it.
<P>
     Studies show that approximately two thirds of the men circumcised as
adults ultimately do not prefer being circumcised.  After an initial
increase in sensitivity due to exposure of the naturally protected glans,
the body then protects itself by building up layers of keratin cells on the
glans and foreskin remnant and both loose their sensitivity.  "Over a period
of years I lost most sensation.  The difference is like night and day.  I
would give anything to get it back." - Journal of Sex Research, 1983.  This
man should contact Steven E. Michaud, the local coordinator for NORM
(National Organization for Restoring Men) at 310/839-5441.  
<P>
     The 7 little boys that one Brooklyn hospital "surgically reassigned"
into girls in the last 10 years after botched circumcisions amputated their
penises should contact the class action suit attorneys at NOHARMM (National
Organization to Halt the Abuse and Routine Mutilation of Males) at
415/826-9351.  They may bring suit until their 19th birthday.  
<P>
     Anyone else who still doesn't get it should try to contact his or her
conscience and rethink the issue.  I'm now reading <I>The Joy of
Uncircumcising</I>, by Jim Bigelow, Ph.D.  I'll let you know about the 
results in a year or two.
