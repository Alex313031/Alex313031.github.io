<h2>Infant Circumcision:

<P>Crime Against Humanity</h2></center>

<br>

<blockquote>
It's time someone said it, loud and clear: that infant
circumcision
-- including so-called "religious" infant circumcision -- is an 
atrocity and a fraud; that it's a brutal, perverse, outrageous 
violation of a helpless human being's right to his own body; that 
it's child sexual abuse in its most vicious, most destructive,
most 
cunningly disguised form; that it literally censors a child's 
life -- <I>kills</I> part of the child -- even if he never
realizes it, 
because it severs him from a uniquely specialized, uniquely
sensitive 
means of perceiving, experiencing, sharing and enjoying his
existence; 
that the reasons given to justify it are myths and lies; that
it's the ugliest, saddest, most sickening scandal in the history
of medicine and an infamy to societies that tolerate it and to 
institutions that sanctify it; and that anyone involved even
remotely with cutting, tearing, crushing or burning off the
foreskins of babies -- or anyone else by force, coercion or 
deceit -- is as guilty of causing human suffering as the monsters
of Auschwitz and in the name of humanity should be exposed,
confronted, stopped, brought to trial, and <I>imprisoned</I>.
<P>
    Regardless of anyone's "reason" for circumcising a baby, the
fact remains that infant circumcision is foreskin amputation
<I>by 
force</I> -- the deliberate, irreversible destruction of a
normal, natural, functional part of
someone else's body -- living, protective, erogenous tissue that 
is rightfully his and that he instinctively wants to keep
intact -- at a time in his life when he can't understand what is
being done to him -- or why -- and can't speak for or protect
himself.
<P>
      Infant circumcision is, in other words, human vivisection
-- legalized, institutionalized, sanctified human vivisection.
<P>
Reason and attempts at persuasion will not deter those who, 
driven by the compulsion to destroy what they secretly envy but can never
have, and desperate to make their own tortured partial penises seem 
normal -- and for who knows what other god-awful reasons --
persist so relentlessly in defending, promoting, misrepresenting and
performing this crippling, disfiguring mutilation.
<P>
      <B>The birthright of males -- <I>all</I> males -- 
to keep all of the penis they are born with must therefore 
be secured <I>by law</I>.</b>
