"Also, with poor hygiene, a foul-smelling, cheesy, 
white secretion called smegma can accumulate under 
the foreskin. Research has shown that smegma may be 
a cancer-causing agent. Therefore, when your son grows 
up, there may be a decreased risk of cancer of the cervix 
in his sexual partners if he has been circumcised."

     "Infant Smegma: Skin cells from the glans of
the penis and the inner foreskin are shed throughout
life. This is especially true in childhood; natural skin
shedding serves to separate the foreskin from the
glans. Since this shedding takes place in a relatively
closed space -- with the foreskin covering the glans --
the shed skin cells cannot escape in the usual manner.
They escape by working their way to the tip of the
foreskin. These escaping discarded skin cells constitute
infant smegma. / "Adult Smegma: Specialized sebaceous glans -- 
Tyson's Glands -- which are located on the glans
under the foreskin, are largely inactive in childhood. At
puberty, Tyson's Glands produce an oily substance,
which when mixed with shed skin cells, constitute
adult smegma. Adult smegma serves as a protective,
lubricating function for the glans." ("Care of the 
Uncircumcised Penis," American Academy of Pediatrics, 1984) 
<P> 

     "An infant's glans is very delicate and can be
seriously irritated by urine. The foreskin acts as a
cover for the glans and produces smegma for a
protective coating." (p. 55) / "As to smegma, the normal secretion
produced under the foreskin, Gairdner claimed that this
substance protects the glans. This is particularly
important if wet diapers are left on too long, since
decomposition of the urine can cause irritation of the
glans if it is not coated with smegma." (p. 64) / "[T]here 
is not a shred of evidence to
support to theory that smegma is carcinogenic." (p. 91) / 
"All animals produce smegma, and none is
circumcised. When mammals reproduce, smegma is
deposited. If smegma contained a carcinogen or even
an irritant, then the propagation of the species would
be jeopardized. No such phenomenon exists." (p. 106)

     "Smegma is probably the most maligned body
substance. It is definitely not a carcinogen (cancer
causing) ... It is no more harmful than other
substances like ear wax ... smegma in either sex
performs a positive, not a negative function."

Ave., Seattle, WA 98112], 1982)

     "Several researchers have tried to prove that
smegma causes cancer; all have failed. Not only is
smegma not harmful, it is actually beneficial, serving
as a protective coating and lubricant for the glans."

Wallerstein, Pennypress, Inc., 1980)

     "This process of rationalization has
culminated in the supposed relationship between the
husband's foreskin and cancer of the genitals--one of
the greatest hoaxes in the history of medicine. The
theory is that the uncircumcised penis, because it may
generate a waxy substance called smegma, can
produce cancer of the penis and cancer of the cervix
(neck of the womb). / "Further evidence that circumcision is
not linked with cancer comes from tests of human
smegma. In 1942, the National Cancer Institute
conducted careful experiments and found that smegma
had no carcinogenic effect whatsoever. This test was
duplicated in 1963 on a more extensive scale by Dr.
D. G. Reddy and others, with the same conclusions.
Negative results have also been obtained in a number
of other experiments (Circumcision in Infancy,  Charles
Weiss, M.D., Clinical Pediatrics, 1964)."

     "Analogous to tears, smegma is the
compilation of secretions by ectopic sebaceous glands
located in the prepuce, the seminal secretions of the
Cowper's gland and the prostate, the mucin content of
the secretions of the urethral glands, and the sloughed
epithelial cells. It provides the necessary mucosal
lubricant and moisturizer and is rich in sexual
pheromones. The prepuce normally prevents detection
of this phenomenally charged scent until the glans is
exposed at the time erection takes place." (<I>Routine 
Neonatal Circumcision: An Update</I>, by Robert S. Van Howe, MD)
<P>
     "Is smegma useful? Yes, certainly. It
lubricates the cavity between the foreskin of the penis
and the glans, thus allows smooth movement between
them during intercourse ... Nature has ... provided
a natural ointment, smegma, to ensure easy
lubrication and protect this delicate region of the male
genital organ. / To secure its even distribution,
smegma is formed from the whole inner surface of the
foreskin cavity ... Smegma production ... is
concentrated in the cells of innumerable small
prominences, minute microscopic protrusions of various
shapes and sizes found on the inner surface of the
foreskin cavity ... Sexual intercourse becomes a
regular feature of life [in adulthood] and the function
of smegma assumes its full value ... Freshly formed
smegma ... is a wholesome lubricant--making for ease
in erection and smoothness in sexual intercourse."

     "If allowed to accumulate for several years,
smegma might possibly cause some irritation. But,
even this is doubtful." (<I>Modern Sex Techniques</I>, by Robert 
Street, Lancer Books, NY, 1959, p. 154)
<P>
   
  "Smegma has been much maligned and
completely misunderstood by most people. It has
several exceedingly crucial functions: by accumulation
starting at the coronal sulcus, it dissects the normally
adherent newborn's prepuce away from the glans; it
prevents re-adherence of the prepuce to the glans; and
throughout life it provides sebaceous-like lubricant to
the entire glans and inner aspect of the prepuce,
which keeps the glans smooth, soft and
sensitive ... The animal kingdom would probably
cease to exist without smegma."
