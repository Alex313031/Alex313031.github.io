<P><B>Should be: Circumcision, deceptively speaking</b> 

<P>Dr Weiss is a known supporter of circumcision. For decades he has 
promoted
cutting off the foreskins of men who as healthy but defenseless babies
didn't request nor need the surgery. As a result of his zeal and that of
countless others (as well as parents misinformed by deceptive pamphlets
such as this) millions of American men live their lives with altered
genitals, and many of them are not even aware of what was taken from them.
Circumcision thrives in ignorance and deceptiveness. The radical nature of
this alteration and its physical and psychological effects are not even
acknowledged by Dr Weiss, nor have they ever been studied by medical
researchers in the US. Nothing is said in this book about the functions of
the foreskin. In Dr Weiss and his co-author's mind, the foreskin cannot
have functions. It must be presented as completely useless, against all
empiric evidence, to make its ablation more palatable. A truthful
exposition of those effects, and of the mutilatory nature of circumcision,
is unlikely for this simple reason: the people who should be conducting
that research are the actual perpetrators of the long term effects of the
procedure to be studied, i.e., the disease is iatrogenic, caused by those
same doctors who pull the strings of medical research funding, and who are
not prone to indict themselves for any wrongdoing. However, the deception
goes beyond that. Circumcision is not a medical procedure, although it has
disguised itself as such in 20th Century America. It is a form of genital
mutilation required by some religions as a ritual of passage or entrance
into the community of believers. Similar rituals affect men and women in
many societies around the world, past and present. Female circumcision in
this basic sense is no different from male circumcision. Among the
religions requiring the circumcision of the new born male, the most
notorious is Judaism. Coincidentally, Dr Weiss is Jewish, and a practicing
Jew at that. To expect him to be honest and truly objective, as well as
interested solely by the physical wellbeing of others, and not fatally
biased by his religious or ethnic beliefs (or superstitions) is
disingenuous. A good analogy would be a similar pamphlet written by a
practising Muslim doctor in Egypt, for intance, making the "medical" case
for female circumcision, which is traditionally performed on small girls in
that country. Wouldn't any discerning reader suspect, quite rightly, that
her conclusions were prompted by her own interest in defending a practice
dear to her religious tradition, and one that herself as a parent feels her
daughters need to endure, just as she endured it before them? Dr Weiss is
doubly deceptive, because he won't acknowledge that as a practicing Jew he
has little choice but to support a practice for which he feels compelled as
a physician to find modern "medical" rationales. His sad pursuit is no
different from that of our not so hypothetical Egyptian physician (many
doctors in Egypt claim that female circumcision is cleaner, reduces sexual
diseases and cancer incidence, makes a girl look like her mother etc etc--
sounds familiar?) Many people in the US, affected themelves by
circumcision, feel a need to deny the mutilatory nature of the procedure,
and vehemently reject any criticism of circumcision. This book obviously is
for them. However, men and women in the US and other mutilating societies
should understand that the effort to end genital mutilation (including male
circumcision disguised as a medical preventive surgery) is for the sake of
the new generations, for them to live happier lives, blessed with physicial
and psychological integrity, and not to make people who have already been
circumcised unhappy or unsatisfied with their lot. It is about breaking the
chain of abuse, not about creating a sense of victimhood. Dr Weiss's
contribution to the pertetuation of the barbarity of circumcision in our
midst will fail, it is my hope, in the face of the truth about
circumcision, as it makes its way despite the resistance and the reaction
of circumcision zealots such as (self-) deceptive Dr Weiss and his 
co-author.
