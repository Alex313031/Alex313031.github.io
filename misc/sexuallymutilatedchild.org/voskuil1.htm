North Dakota Board of Medical Examiners
<br>Rolf Sletten, Executive Director
<br>418 East Broadway, Suite C10
<br>Bismarck, ND 58501

<P>To the North Dakota Board of Medical Examiners and the 
Commission on Medical Competency:

<P>We place the following Accusation before the Board: Routine
infant
circumcisers (if individuals need be cited: Roger Allen, MD and
Manuel
Neto, MD, Minot) are practicing quack medicine, namely, a pattern
of
inappropriate and fraudulent care.

<P><b>Request</b>: that the NDBME discipline circumcisers
(namely, Roger Allen, MD and
Manuel Neto, MD, Minot) for practicing quackery (request made
under NDCC
43-17.1-05: "All residents have the right to make or refer
complaints to the
commission...").

<P><B>Accusation's Legal Basis</b>: NDCC 43-17.1-07 
(Sec. 4) and 43-17-31 (Sec. 6 and 7):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The board of medical examiners may
revoke or suspend a physician's
license to practice medicine in this state or may attach
conditions or
restrictions thereto on any one or more of the following
grounds:... 4. A
continued pattern of inappropriate care, including unnecessary
surgery, in
the performance of his duties as a physician." (emphasis added)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The board may refuse to
grant a license to practice medicine in
this state or may suspend or revoke such license...upon any of
the following
grounds:... 6. The performance of any dishonorable, unethical, or
unprofessional <I>conduct likely to deceive, defraud, or harm the
public.  7.
The use of any false or fraudulent statement</I> in any document
connected with
the practice of medicine." (emphasis added)

<P><b>Basis for Board's Authority and Need for Action</b>: A.
Michael 
Booth, MD, PhD,
in testimony, 2/13/95, that helped defeat ND HB 1381 (1 endnote)
argued this
Bill would "cripple the State Board of Medical Examiners" by
restricting its
ability to "act against a physician by suspending or revoking his
or her
license on the simple finding of a continued pattern (2 endnote)
of
inappropriate care." (3 endnote)

<P>We must assume Dr. Booth, as a member of NDMA and its
Commission on
Legislative Affairs, and as President of the ND Chapter of the
American
College of Surgeons, has a good sense for the powers of the
NDBME. One of
these is the power to determine what "appropriate care" means.

<P>Dr. Booth pointed out that quackery is inappropriate care. He
quoted the
U.S. Congress Select Committee on Aging's definition of a "quack"
in its
1984 report on quackery. A quack is "anyone who promotes medical
schemes or
remedies known to be false, or <I>which are unproven</I>, for
profit." (emphasis
added) He pointed out North Dakota has not been free of quacks,
but "the
Board has acted appropriately to remove them." This is fortunate,
according
to Booth, or the expected and needed trust in physicians would
have been
seriously eroded. "Indeed, had the Board failed to act, the
public would
have had every reason to believe that the relationship of trust
between
patient and physician had been knowingly violated." (emphasis
added)

<P>Dr. Booth pointed out that "These practitioners of quack
medicine [have]
always been difficult to deal with." They are successful
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        (a) because of their ability
to "take a bit of scientific fact and
then extrapolate [it] to incredible proportions to justify the
use of their
therapy, oftentimes ignoring the very real toxic potential that
their
treatments involve..." and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        (b) because "too often, the
victims of these practitioners fail to
take action, out of embarrassment..."

<P><b><big><center>Summary of Accusation</center></big></b>

<P><b>A. Circumcision is quack medicine.</b> Routine infant
circumcision meets every
definition of "quack medicine" and is, therefore, "inappropriate
care." It
is:

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        (1)  based on "a bit of
scientific fact" which is "extrapolate[d] to
incredible proportions to justify the use of their therapy,
oftentimes
ignoring the very real toxic potential that their treatments
involve...."
When all the evidence is examined, it is seen to be physically
and
psychologically harmful to the infant, his parents and society at
large.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        (2)  fraudulent since the
circumciser fails to provide full
information, either from lack of knowledge or deliberate
misrepresentation.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        (3)  at least a quarter
billion dollar business in the U.S.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        (4)  a subject that
embarrasses people, so corrective action is not
taken.

<P><B>B. Circumcision violates human rights.</b> Infant
circumcision, however, is more
than just the usual form of quack medicine. Circumcision does not
just
defraud the person who is persuaded by misleading information to
consent to
the procedure for him or herself. The patient, in this case, has
no say at
all. The amputation is forced upon a completely non-consenting
individual.
No one has the right to unnecessarily alter an infant's physical
integrity.


<P><b><center><big>Supporting Arguments for Accusations</big>

<P>A (cont.): Support for Statements that
<br>Circumcision is Quack Medicine:
</center></b>

<P><B>Support for point (1)-Harmful, not beneficial, care based
on inadequate
evidence:</b>

<P>Published studies, considering all the known so-called
physiological and
cost benefits, show no positive balance of actual benefit can be
determined,
even when these studies ignore the negative weight of
psychological damage
and human rights violations. (4 endnote)

<P>For example, in an article in <I>Family Medicine</I>,
"Circumcision: A Decision
Analysis of its Medical Value," Oct-Dec 1991, Dr. Lawler writes,
"We
conclude there is no medical indication for or against
circumcision. The
decision may most reasonably be made on non-medical factors such
as parent
preference."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We would like to suggest that
the child's preference is the only one
that counts.

<P>In another article in <I>Medical Decision Making</I>, Oct-Dec
1991, Dr. Ganiats
states: "Circumcision has essentially no effect on either dollar
costs or
health. For this reason, personal factors could justly be brought
into the
decision process."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Even though those doing these
studies have not faced the human
rights issue, nor long-term psychological or sexual effects, they
make
clear, that circumcision is not a procedure to be justified on
medical
grounds.

<P>Thomas Wiswell's urinary tract infection studies is a typical
example of
those who take "a bit of scientific fact and then extrapolate to
incredible
proportions to justify the use of their therapy." He even claims
God made a
mistake providing men with this erotic and protective tissue. One
has to
circumcise 99 infants to prevent one UTI, even if Wiswell's
retrospective
study on military babies is accurate, which other researchers
question
because catherization was used to gather urine samples and may
have
contaminated them, and because of invalid statistical analyses.
Girls are
four times as prone to UTIs as boys in any case.

<P>100,000 infants must be circumcised to prevent one penile
cancer. Who
explains to parents that more infants die of circumcision
complications in
the U.S. than older men are saved from penile cancer (about 200)?
We still
hear about the cervical cancer study--proved invalid decades ago.
This is
just some of the persistent misleading information the quacks
dispense or
fail to correct. Their approach allows them to hood-wink a
trusting public
into a procedure with "very real toxic potential."

<P>In fact, all national and international healthcare and medical
organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians
and
Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, say these
amputations
are not medically necessary. How can they, therefore, be defined
as
"preventive medicine" when imposed upon a <I>non-consenting</I>
person? They are
<I>unnecessary surgeries</I>, and as such must be censored by
Board action pursuant
to NDCC 43-17.1-07 (Sec. 4).

<P>Surgical amputation of normal tissue can only be called
"mutilation."
Perhaps we do have a right to mutilate ourselves, but not others.
As Ron
Miller, MD, Fargo, says, "What risk is acceptable when one is
tampering with
something that is normal?" The following is a list of a few more
North
Dakota people and organizations that have recognized the
non-necessary
nature of routine infant circumcision: (5 endnote)

<P>* Rhonda Ketterling, MD, Chair, ND Board of Medical Examiners,
Medical
Director for U.S. Healthcare, Bismarck, and practicing physician,
Rugby. 
<BR>* Arlene Mack, RN, Vice President, Medcenter One, Support
Services (speaking
for Medcenter One, she said their physicians have agreed not to
recommend
circumcisions and will explain the risks). 
<BR>* Shari Orser, MD, Chair,
Department of Ob/Gyn, Medcenter One, Bismarck. 
<BR>* Robert Wentz, MD,
pediatrician, former ND State Health Officer, now Deputy
Insurance
Commissioner. 
<BR>* Jon Rice, MD, ND State Health Officer. 
<BR>* Sister Mary
Margaret Mooney, PBVM, RN, Professor and Chair, Department of
Nursing,
University of Mary. 
<BR>* Gladys Cairns, Director, ND Child Protective Services
and Chair of the Alliance for Sexual Abuse Prevention and
Treatment. 
<BR>* Craig
Shoemaker, MD, Director of Neonatal Services and Chair,
Department of
Pediatrics, Fargo Clinic MeritCare. 
<BR>* Ron H. Miller, MD, pediatrician, Fargo
Clinic MeritCare. 
<BR>* Alan Lindemann, MD, Ob/Gyn, Fargo. 
<BR>* Thomas W. Mausbach,
MD, former President, ND Chapter of the American Academy of
Pediatrics (in a
letter to the NDBME). 
<BR>* Charles Severn, MD, Chair, Department of
Neonatology, St. Alexius Medical Center, Bismarck. 
<BR>* Connie Kalanek, MSN,
RNC, Associate Professor, Medcenter One College of Nursing. 
<BR>* Robert
Roswick, MD, and Jeffrey Smith, MD, Family Medical Center,
Bismarck. 
<BR>* Judy
Haynes, PhD, UND Counseling Center and clinical psychologist,
Grand Forks. 
<BR>* Robert Pathroff, MD, urologist, Bismarck. 
<br>* Roger Allen, MD, neonatologist, Minot. 
<BR>* BlueCross BlueShield of North Dakota. 
<BR>* Medicaid (does not pay for this unnecessary surgery).

<P>Even Roger Allen, MD, Minot, cited above as being a
circumciser, said
parents make up their minds about circumcision, not on any
scientific or
medical basis, but on emotion, one of the hallmarks of quackery.
In a
television interview (KMOT, 11/92) he said "There is no
compelling reason to
do a circumcision, but on the other hand, there is no compelling
reason not
to." The only adequate response to such a self-serving statement
was made by
Janet Wentz, North Dakota Republican Legislator, <I>"If there is
no compelling
reason to do a circumcision, that is a compelling reason not to
do one."</I>
This, we hope, will be the appropriate response of the NDBME.

<P>Since science, not custom, must be the final arbiter of
appropriateness for procedures forced upon non-consenting
individuals, circumcisers must
scientifically justify their practice, or it simply stands as a
quack
procedure. We ask you, <I>where are the studies to justify</I>
this painful,
disfiguring and sexually de-sensitizing practice?

<P><center>
<B>Support for point (2)-Fraudulent or incompetent practitioners
and 
practices:</B>
</center>

<P>Perhaps there are circumcisers who do not know the facts. But
<I>ignorance can
no longer justify the continuation of this practice</I>. It
certainly cannot be
a basis for not censoring them. It is a reason that makes Board
action more
imperative, since well-meaning practitioners, who believe in
their own quack
procedures, may work their damage even more insidiously on
society.

<P>The prestige of the medical profession is truly at stake here.
Numerous and
angry people can be brought before the Commission to testify to
how little
information they were given, or how misleading it was, before
giving
<I>uninformed</I> consent to maim their sons. They know they were
defrauded, and
some are even looking into law suits. Some did not provide
written consent
to the unnecessary surgery.

<P><center><B>
Support for point (3)-Financially self-serving at amputee's
expense:
</B></center>

<P>Journals providing medical statistics use the quarter billion
dollar
figure. It does not include the multi-million dollar law suits
arising out
of "botched jobs" nor the reconstructive costs to the 1 in 500
which are
seriously botched, according the American Academy of Pediatrics.
(6 endnote)
Of course, any unnecessary amputation is a "botched job," as so
well put by
the obstetric nursing staff at St. Vincent Hospital, Sante Fe,
NM, who
refuse to participate in the procedure. Their conscientious
objector status
has just been negotiated into a legally binding agreement.

<P><center><b>
Support for point (4)-Embarrassment prevents exposure:
</b></center>

<P>Discussion of genitals is taboo in our society. Acquiring and
dispensing
accurate information on any taboo subject is difficult.
Circumcisers, and
all quacks, profit from lack of exposure. The media has a hard
time
providing information from fear of offending the public. Once
someone has
been circumcised, has allowed it or done it, the ritualization of
the act
often keeps one from publicly admitting a wrong. Passing an act
on to the
next generation is often easier than admitting the act was
wrongfully done
to oneself.

<P><center><b>
B (cont.): Support for Accusation that
<br>Circumcision Violates Human Rights.
</b></center>
<P>Parental rights do not extend to unnecessary genital
amputations. Now, it is
true that "Parents, guardians, and custodians are authorized to
consent to
<I>healthcare</I> on behalf of children" (NDCC Sec. 23-11-13,
emphasis added), but
routine infant circumcision is not a healthcare issue. No study
with its
"bit of scientific fact" (Booth) offered to support the purported
positive
effects of prepuce amputation, has ever been able to establish
that the
negative physiological effects are not more significant, not to
mention
other physiological and psychological effects that result from
functioning
with a violated body.

<P><B>Historically</b>, medical rationalizations are a recent
approach used by
quacks. Except for the last hundred years in the U.S.,
circumcision has
never been done for health reasons. The appeal to scientific
evidence to
justify it as a healthcare issue is major healthcare fraud. (7
endnote)
Since most men in the developed and underdeveloped countries of
the world
are intact and do not have the dire problems circumcisers
threaten will
occur, the procedure in the U.S. is obviously a non-medical
ritual. This is
understood by many North Dakota physicians.

<P><I>Medical ethics</I> clearly requires physicians to decline
to do follow a
parent's wish to alter a child surgically for non-medical
reasons. The
physician is even required to <I>prevent others from doing
so!</I> (see NDCC
50-25.1-03-Persons required to report child abuse and neglect).
No one in
our society can morally (and we believe, legally) alter another
surgically
against his will for non-medical reasons, even if he is one's own
son.
Property rights do not extend to one's son or daughter (8
endnote).

<P><B>Sexism</b> is inherent in the present practice. The
physician's responsibility
to protect a helpless patient is recognized when it comes to all
other
operations and for genital amputations on female children (9
endnote) (which
has now been formalized in ND SB2454, 1995) along with NDCC
50-25.1-03.

<P><b><big><center>
Summary and Request for Action
</center></big></b>

<P>Information and testimony to support this allegation will be
gladly
provided. (10 endnote) However, we ardently maintain the evidence
is such,
despite the cultural conditioning and prevalence of prepucial
amputations,
that <I>circumcisers are the ones who must justify their
actions</I> to the Board
on sound medical and scientific evidence. They must prove routine
infant
circumcision is in line with the physician's oath: <B>First Do No
Harm</b>.
This
justification must not be the little piece of scientific evidence
that
quacks use. It must be the whole spectrum, including the physical
injuries
and deaths as well the increasing evidence of negative long-term
psychological effects and diminishment of sexual function.

<P>The citizens of North Dakota have a right to expect the Board
is monitoring
and preventing unnecessary surgical procedures and fraudulent
practices.
<I>Amputations of healthy prepuces from non-consenting
individuals is
unnecessary surgery, or more accurately, contraindicated,
surgery</I>.
It harms
our children and violates their human rights. It is a practice
international
community views as abhorrent as we do female genital mutilations.
Now that
North Dakota is taking the lead nationally in outlawing FGM, a
move
supported by the ND Medical Association, citizens and legislators
are asking
why male circumcisers are allowed to traumatize our male infants.
They want
to know why our appointed state officials and medical
associations do not
advocate for protection of male infants.

<P>Yet, with the recognition that in some way we are all victims
of the
anti-masturbation hysteria which established the practice of
routine infant
circumcision a hundred years ago, we ask not that circumcisers
(namely, Neto
and Allen) be harshly disciplined for past acts, but we do ask
the Board to
declare the procedure to be inappropriate care and to warn
potential
circumcisers that future amputations of a healthy prepuces will
be treated
by the Board for what they are: quack medicine.

<P>If the Board or Commission does not declare routine infant
circumcision to
be inappropriate care, the citizens of North Dakota deserve a
point by point
explanation why not, <I>giving scientific evidence</I> to support
the points. We
trust the Board will act to protect those who are too helpless to
protect
themselves.

<P>History will not be kind to us in our perpetuation and
<I>tolerance</I>
of this grave violation of human rights and dignity.

<P>Endnotes:

<P>(1) Defeated HB 1381 read: "A physician's use of complementary
or
alternative therapies does not constitute a continued pattern of
inappropriate care, unless there is demonstrable physical harm to
patients."

<P>(2) Ralph Kilzer, MD, in response to a question, 2/27/95, from
the ND
House Human Services Committee as to why the state needed a bill
outlawing
FGM when this seems like an issue the NDBME should be able to
handle,
responded that the NDBME generally looks for a pattern of
inappropriate
care, whereas one unnecessary amputation of normal female genital
tissue
would be grounds for criminal action. He said "for normal tissue
there is no
useful medical purpose for amputating [female?] genital tissue."
Circumcisers who do prepuce amputations routinely have such a
pattern of
inappropriate care.

<P>(3)In this regard, the letter from the ND Commission on
Medical Competency
to Ramona T. Goheen, 11/29/94,  responding to her complaint
against Manuel
Neto's inappropriate handling of her son's genitals, fails once
again to
address the real issue. Even if it were true that the Commission
could,
somehow, find no law (such as battery) under which to discipline
Neto for a
single act of forcibly separating the immature preputial tissue
from the
glans (against the express wishes of Ms. Goheen) and recommending
circumcision for a child with hypospadias (contrary to textbook
recommendations), and doing so while saying it must be done so he
doesn't
get picked on by other boys and so he will to do better in
school, still
Neto has been following "a pattern of inappropriate care" in
forcible
retraction of immature prepuces and in surgically removing
healthy
functioning tissue from non-consenting people. The law is clear
enough on
this. What is at issue here is not whether a law exists, but
whether the
Commission has the will to apply it. No law gives physicians the
right to
remove healthy functioning tissue from non-consenting people, be
it the male
genitalia or any other tissue. Circumcision, in Neto's mind, it
seems, as in
many others, is surgical alteration to accomplish  psychological
ends.

<P>(6) These figures are likely at the low end. The following
quotation is
from the Journal of Family Law (copy enclosed), Vol. 23, No. 3,
1985, by
William E. Brigman, PhD: "Not only is routine surgery
unwarranted, but an
article published in 1966 in <I>The Canadian Medical Association
Journal</I>
['The
Problem of Routine Circumcision'] reported a complication rate
running as
high as 55% for hospital-performed routine neonatal circumcision.
Other
studies showed that approximately 10% of all circumcisions had to
be
repeated [Id.]. While most of the surgical complications were
minor, Dr.
Robert L. Baker, writing in a 1979 issue of <I>Sexual Medicine
Today</I>
calculated
that 229 infants died in the United States per year as a result
of
circumcision [Baker, 'Newborn Male Circumcision: Needless and
Dangerous,'
<I>Sexual Medicine Today</I>, Nov. 1979].

<P>(7) The fraud began over a hundred years ago as people were
persuaded to
mutilate genitals in many ways in order to discourage
masturbation. Quacks
played on people's fear that "self-pleasuring" would cause nearly
every
known ailment. Circumcision was actually thought to be one of the
least
painful ways prescribed to "cure" masturbation. Females were also
genitally
maimed, one we know of had her clitoris excised by a Wahpeton,
ND, physician
forty-some years ago.

<P>(8) Rights of parents to do what they will with their children
must be
limited, testified Burleigh County States Attorney Patricia Burke
opposing
HCR3036, otherwise the law  would not be able to do anything
about the
father "who initiated this teenaged daughter into sex because he
wanted her
to learn about it from 'someone who really cares.'" Quoted from
the Bismarck
Tribune, 3/2/95, Sec. B. Also see an excellent article in the
California Law
Review, "Parents' Religion and Children's Welfare: Debunking the
Doctrine of
Parents' Rights," Dec. 1994. The notion that a person can own
another only
survives in some court judgments (since the freeing of slaves and
wives) in
the parent/child relationship to the child's detriment.

<P>(9) Ralph Kilzer, MD, speaking for the ND Medical Association
in support of
SB 2454 said the NDMA endorsed the AMA's Policy Recommendations
which read:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "1. That the AMA support
legislation to eliminate the performance of
female genital mutilation in the United States and to protect
young girls
and women at risk of undergoing the procedure.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "2. That physicians who are
requested to perform female genital
mutilation on a patient provide culturally sensitive counseling
to educate
the patient and her family members about the negative health
consequences of
the procedure, and discourage them from having the procedure
performed.
Where possible, physicians should refer the patient to social
support groups
that can help them cope with changing societal mores."

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The AMA's policy statement
ends with an Action Recommendation:
"That the AMA join other organizations, including the World
Health
Organization, the World Medical Association, interested national
medical
societies, UNICEF and the International Federation of Gynecology
and
Obstetrics in strongly opposing all forms of medically
unnecessary surgical
modification of the <I>female</I> genitalia, promoting awareness
of 
<I>female</I> genital
mutilation to the public and health care workers, and education
health
professionals around the world to eliminate the practice of 
<i>female</i> genital
mutilation." (emphasis added) No reasons were given for the
exclusion of
males in this formal statement.
