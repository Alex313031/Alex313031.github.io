<p>These five photographs show the three zones of skin on a normal, 
intact (non-circumcised) adult penis: 

<ul><ul>

A. the skin covering the shaft (the area above the upper [blue] line in each 
photograph);

<P>B. the foreskin's outside fold (the area between the two lines in each 
photograph); 

<P>C. the foreskin's inside fold (the area below the lower [green] line in each
photograph), visible only when the foreskin is retracted. 

</ul></ul>

<br>1. Penis slightly tumescent. The area between the upper (blue) line and the 
lower (green) line is the foreskin's outside fold. The foreskin's outside fold 
is almost as long as the skin covering the shaft. 
The foreskin's inside fold, equal in length to and covered by
the foreskin's outside fold, is not visible.
Well over half of the total penile skin is foreskin.

<br>2. The foreskin retracted (manually) about an inch. 
The area between the upper (blue) line and the lower (green) line is the foreskin's 
mostly retracted outside fold. 
The area below the lower line is the first half inch or so of the 
foreskin's partially retracted inside fold. 
<br clear=left>

<P><img src="33-31cb.jpg" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10> 
<br>3. The foreskin retracted. The area between the upper (blue) line and the 
lower (green) line is the foreskin's retracted outside fold. 
The area below the lower (green) line is the foreskin's retracted inside fold, 
gathered behind the coronal sulcus.

<P><img src="33-32cb.jpg" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10> 
<br>4. The foreskin retracted farther. Almost the entire penile shaft is 
now covered with foreskin. The area between the upper (blue) line and the lower 
(green) line is the foreskin's retracted outside fold. 
The area between the lower (green) line and the glans 
is the foreskin's retracted inside fold. If the skin were released, it 
would return to its position in #3. 
<br clear=left>

<P><img src="33-33cb.jpg" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10> 
<br>5. The foreskin retracted as far as it will comfortably go. The area 
between the lower (green) line (the only line now visible) and the glans is the 
foreskin's fully retracted inside fold. (One of the fingers holding the 
foreskin back is partially visible.) The entire penile shaft is now 
covered with foreskin. Well over half of the shaft is covered with 
the foreskin's retracted inside fold. Veins, arteries, capillaries, and 
smooth glans texture clearly visible.

These five photographs are the last five photographs of
<I>33 Photographs of the Intact Adult Male Foreskin</I>, 
exhibited at the Third International Symposium on 
Circumcision at the University of Maryland, May 22-25, 1994. They 
have been printed in <I>Awakenings: A Preliminary Poll of Circumcised 
Men (Revealing the Long-Term Harm and Healing the Wounds of Infant 
Circumcision)</I> (NOHARMM, 1994); the November 1995 issue of the 
Montreal newspaper, <I>Le Presse</I>; 
<i>Sexual Mutilations: A Human Tragedy</i> (Procedings of the 
Fourth International Symposium on Circumcision, Lausanne, Switzerland, 
August 9-11, 1996) (Plenum, 1997); and elsewhere. 
Attorney David 
Llewellyn (Atlanta Circumcision Information Center) told me they 
helped the jury arrive at its verdict in the successful wrongful 
circumcision lawsuit in Birmingham, Alabama, 1995, in which he was 
attorney for the plaintiff.
