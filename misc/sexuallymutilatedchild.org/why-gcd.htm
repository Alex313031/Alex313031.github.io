As a medical student at America's oldest hospital, Pennsylvania
Hospital, I was happy to be on the obstetrics rotation. While
still in college, I had heard an obstetrician speak
enthusiastically about his optimistic specialty. So now I was
enjoying helping to bring babies into the world. While professors
provided good background information in formal lectures, my real
teachers, of course, were residents only a few years older than I
was. They took turns talking me through normal deliveries. 

<P>Almost every doctor can recall the joy of delivering a healthy
normal infant. This joy was shattered one day when one of the
residents - a resident I did not know well - said, "There are
some circumcisions that need to be done - go and do them!" At the
time I guess I knew what a circumcision was - but that was about
it. I had certainly learned nothing about the subject in medical
school. Obediently, I proceeded to the newborn nursery, where
another medical student, a brilliant young Jewish man, was
already waiting. I felt nervous, and he looked quite nervous,
too.  Strapped to a board on the long counter in front of each of
us was a bawling male infant. Beside the infant was a surgical
tray filled with instruments. Imagine our consternation when we
found there was no one to tell us what to do. Obediently, we put
on surgical gowns, then surgical gloves. Then we began to try to
figure out how to use what I later learned was a Gomco Clamp.

<P>As far as I know, I made a fairly neat job of it. But my abiding
memory of that day is of my Jewish colleague. He was one of the
more brilliant members of our class, and was planning to become
an outstanding radiologist. As for surgery, forget it. He was all
thumbs. I still remember him, standing beside me, fumbling with
the complicated instruments, proceeding to use them on the
helpless penis before him, all the while just shaking his head! 

<P>I look back on the only time I have ever performed any
circumcisions with regret and resentment.  I resent having had no
opportunity to study circumcision in medical school or to
consider whether I thought it a treatment for anything. I resent
the resident commanding me to do it, while offering no further
guidance or help. In fact, I was treated just as the medical
profession treats innocent new parents today. Doctors tell them a
circumcision needs to be done. Before the new parent has time to
consider, it is all over. Then it is too late to say no, and
everyone has to live with the consequences. I was a medical
student, so a lot of the responsibility was mine. I clearly
violated, all in one instant, the Golden Rule (I certainly would
not have wanted that done to me); the major tenet of medical
practice, First, Do No Harm; and all seven Principles of the
American Medical Association's Code of Ethics. Mind you, I did
not realize it then, just as unwary medical students do not
realize it today. Now I know there are no valid medical
indications for routine neonatal circumcision. I realize much
harm can be done, evidenced by the thousands of men who have
written their testimony and who have told me personally of the
harm done to them. Now I also realize that I violated my
patient's basic human right to enjoy his entire body intact,
while all he could do was scream his tiny head off. That was some
years ago, but it might just as well have been last year, or this
year. 

<P>The United States is the only country in the world that, for no
religious reason, severs part of the penis from the majority of
its newborn males. I speak out in the hope that many parents and
doctors will read this before getting swept into the cultural
madness of routine neonatal circumcision.  What should one do if
called upon to consent to or to perform circumcisions? Just say
NO! In so doing, you will be taking the only ethical position
there is on this issue.
