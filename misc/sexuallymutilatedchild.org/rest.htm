    "The effects of circumcision persist for a lifetime. 
Circumcision is the only surgical
     procedure where the decision to operate is made solely by parents 
who frequently know very little
     about penile anatomy and function. Choose wisely! [This book] 
provides the background for making
     that choice." (Thomas J. Ritter, MD, author of <I>Say No to 
Circumcision! 40 Compelling Reasons</I>)

<P>"Circumcision is not a medical issue; it is a human rights 
issue. This book will help the
     reader understand why ... I would not have had to write 
"Circumcision: What I Wish I Had
     Known" if I had read this book first." (Marilyn F. Milos, RN, 
Founder/Director, NOCIRC)
