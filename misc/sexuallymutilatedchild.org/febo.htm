<blockquote>
"Circumcision is extremely painful -- and traumatic --
for a baby. The often repeated statement that babies can't
feel pain is not true. Babies are as sensitive to pain as
anyone else. Just being strapped down is frightening for a
baby. Most babies scream frantically when their foreskins
are cut off. Some defecate. Some lapse into coma. The
reason some babies don't cry when they are circumcised is
that they <I>can't</I> cry because <I>they are in a state of
shock</I>."

circumcision is that for some babies the shock of the

<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Febo used to spend long
hours curled 
up at my feet,
and every so often he would get up, walk over to the door,
and turn and look at me. I would go and open the door for
him, and he would go out, coming back after an hour or
two.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day he went out and
never came 
back. I waited for
him until evening, and when night fell rushed through the
streets, calling him by name. I returned home at dead of
night and threw myself on my bed, facing the half-open door.
Every so often I would go to the window and call him again
and again in a loud voice. At daybreak I again rushed
through the deserted streets.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as it was daylight I
rushed 
to the municipal dog prison.
I went into a grey room where I found a number
of whining dogs, shut up in stinking cages, their necks
still bearing the marks of the noose. The caretaker told me
that my dog might have been run over by a car, or stolen, or
thrown into the river by a gang of young hooligans. He
advised me to go the round of the dog-shops: who could say
that Febo was not in some dog-shop?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the morning I rushed
about from 
one dog-shop to
another, and at last a canine barber in a dirty little shop
near the Piazza dei Cavalieri asked me if I had been to the
University Veterinary Clinic, to which dog-thieves were in
the habit of selling cheaply the animals that were
subsequently used for clinical experiments. I rushed to the
University, but it was already past midday and the
Veterinary Clinic was closed. I returned home. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the afternoon I returned
to the 
University and went
into the Veterinary Clinic. My heart was thumping, I was so
weak and in such agony of mind that I could hardly walk. I
asked for the doctor on duty and told him my name. The
doctor, a fair-haired, short-sighted young man with a tired
smile received me courteously and gazed at me for a long
time before replying that he would do everything possible to
help me.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened the door and we
entered a 
large, clean,
bright room, the floor of which was covered with blue
linoleum. Along the walls, one beside the other, like beds
in a children's clinic, were rows of strange cradles, shaped
like cellos. In each of the cradles was a dog, lying on its
back, with its stomach exposed, or its skull split, or its
chest gaping open.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The edges of those dreadful
wounds were 
held apart by
thin steel wires, wound round wooden pegs of the kind that
in musical instruments serves to keep the strings taut. One
could see the naked heart beating; the lungs, with the veins
of the bronchial tubes looking like the branches of a tree,
swelling exactly as the foliage of a tree does when the wind
blows; the red, shining liver very slowly contracting;
slight tremors running through the pink and white substance
of the brain as in a steamy mirror; the coils of the
intestines sluggishly disentangling themselves like a heap
of snakes waking from their deep slumber. And not a moan
came from the half-open mouths of the tortured dogs.      
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we entered all the dogs
turned 
their eyes upon us.
They gazed at us imploringly, and at the same time their
expressions were full of a dread foreboding. They followed
our every gesture with their eyes, watching us with
trembling lips. Standing motionless in the middle of the
room, I felt a chill spreading through my limbs; little by
little I became as if turned to stone. I could not open my
lips. I could not move a step. The doctor laid his hand on
my arm. "Courage," he said. The word dispelled the chill
that was in my bones; slowly I moved, and bent over the
first cradle. As I proceeded from cradle to cradle the
colour returned to my face, and my heart dared to hope. Then
suddenly I saw Febo.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was lying on his back,
his stomach 
exposed and a
probe buried in his liver. He was staring at me; his eyes
were full of tears. He was breathing gently, his mouth
half-open, and his body was trembling horribly. He was
staring at me, and an agonizing pain stabbed my
heart. "Febo," I said in a low voice, bending over him
and stroking his forehead. Febo kissed my hand, and not a
moan escaped him.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor came up to me and
touched 
my arm. "I can't
interrupt the experiment," he said. "It's not allowed. But
for your sake I'll give him an injection. He won't suffer."
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took the doctor's hand in
mine. "Swear 
to me that he won't 
suffer," I said, while the tears rolled down my cheeks.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He'll fall asleep forever,"
said the 
doctor. "I would like my death to be as peaceful as his."
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said: "I'll close my eyes.
I don't want 
to see him die. But be quick--be quick!"
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will only take a
moment," said the 
doctor, and he moved noiselessly away, gliding over the soft
carpet of
linoleum. He went to the end of the room and opened a cupboard.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remained standing before
Febo. I was trembling
horribly; tears were running down my face. Febo was staring
at me, and not the faintest moan escaped him. The
other dogs, lying on their backs in their cradles, were also
staring at me and not the faintest moan escaped them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly I uttered a cry of
terror. "Why this
silence?" I shouted. "What does this silence mean?"
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a horrible silence--a
vast, chilling, 
deathly silence, the silence of snow.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor approached me
with a syringe 
in his hand. "Before we operate on them," he said, "we cut their 
vocal cords."
