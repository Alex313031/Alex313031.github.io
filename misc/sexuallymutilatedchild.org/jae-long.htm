[This is the longest letter -- by far -- I've ever written.]

<P>March 22, 1992

<P>I'd like to ask you a question about "The Circumcision
Decision," by Katherine Karlsrud, MD, and Dodi Schultz, in your
January 1990 issue. 
<P>
     It contains no information about many of the thoroughly
documented facts about circumcision that are making a growing
number of parents -- even Jewish parents -- decide against it.
<P>
     There's nothing about the protective, sensory, or sexual
functions of the foreskin. 
<P>
     Nothing about the trauma of the circumcision operation. 
<P>
     Nothing about the risks of anesthesia. 
<P>
     Nothing about the occasional, inevitable circumcision
disasters.
<P>
     Nothing about the tremendous loss of sensitivity reported by
males circumcised as adults.
<P>
     Nothing about circumcision as a cause of psychological harm
and sexual dysfunction. 
<P>
     Nothing about the fact that the vast majority of males who
are given the choice prefer to keep their foreskins intact. 
<P>
     Nothing about the resentment many males have expressed about
having had part of their penis cut off without their consent. 
<P>
     Nothing about the growing perception of infant circumcision
as a violation of human rights.
<P>
     Nothing about the moral/ethical/legal implications of being
aware of these considerations but circumcising babies anyway. 
<P>
     Nothing about the many sources of information about
circumcision now available: books, videos and NOCIRC
centers throughout the country.
<P>
     Nothing, even, about the thoroughly documented risk of
death. 
<P>
     How can this be?
<P>
     Are you and the authors of that article unaware of this
information? Or are you aware of it but withholding it from your
readers?
<P>
     Which? I can't think of any other possibility. 
<P>
     The article is a virtual encyclopedia of confusing,
misleading, deceptively worded, outdated statements: the
"prevents problems" scare; the "lifetime commitment to penile
hygiene" scare; the "cervical cancer" scare; the "might have to
be circumcised later" scare; the "trauma if circumcised later"
scare; the "high cost of being circumcised later" scare; the
"won't match his father" scare; the recent urinary-tract
infections scare. 
<P>
     But I draw your attention specifically to Dr. Karlsrud's
horrendous false statement that "nerve pathways are thought to be
less developed in newborn babies." 
<P>
     Thought by whom? 
<P>
     Not by Rosemary Romberg, author of <I>Circumcision: The Painful
Dilemma</I>. Not by Edward Wallerstein, author of <I>Circumcision: An
American Health Fallacy</I>. Not by Anne Briggs, author of
<I>Circumcision: What Every Parent Should Know</I>. Not by Billy Boyd,
author of <I>Circumcision: What It Does</I> [reprinted as
<i>Circumcision Exposed: Rethinking a Medical and Cultural 
Tradition</i>]. Not by Thomas Ritter, MD,
author of <I>Say No to Circumcision: 40 Compelling Reasons</I>. Not by
Marilyn Milos, RN, founder and director of the National
Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers. Not by
the American Academy of Pediatrics. Not by anyone who has
circumcised a baby or seen a baby being circumcised. (Anyone who
has ever circumcised a baby or seen a baby being circumcised and
says babies don't feel pain, is lying.) Not, in short, by anyone
who knows what he or she is talking about. 
<P>
     And certainly not by the screaming, struggling, vomiting,
defecating baby having a normal, sensitive, functional part of
his penis cut off. 
<P>
     I'm enclosing a copy of "'A Scream We Will Never Forget' and
Other Statements Documenting Infant Circumcision Pain." 
<P>
     Please notice that, except for a few anecdotal statements,
these statements are from authoritative sources. 
<P>
     I direct your attention to the following statements in
particular: 
<UL><UL>
     "The pain of [infant] circumcision is a fact." 
<P>
     "The operation is decidedly painful."
<P>
     "[E]ven premature babies are capable of feeling deep
pain in surgery." 
<P>
     "Newborn babies have that much more feelings, more
sensitivity, and are more vulnerable to pain than older
children." 
<P>
     "A newborn baby is ... as able to perceive pain as any
other person." 
</ul></ul>
     And especially -- in contrast to the statement in Dr.
Karlsrud's article -- this statement from the American Academy of
Pediatrics' 1989 <I>Report of the Ad Hoc Task Force on Circumcision</I>:

<ul><ul>

     "Pain pathways as well as the cortical and subcortical
centers necessary for pain perception are well developed by the
third trimester." 

</ul></ul>

     I would very much like to know your response to these and
the other statements on the enclosed sheet. 

<P>
     It's too late for the babies who will have to go through
life without a foreskin because their parents read Dr. Karlsrud's
article and therefore thought they were "informed." 
<P>
     But it's not too late for babies yet to be born. It's not
too late to tell your readers that the statement about infant
circumcision pain in your January 1990 issue is false. It's not
too late to tell your readers that, according to the most
informed, up-to-date, authoritative sources, <I>babies feel as much
pain when their genitals are clamped, slit, torn, crushed,
sliced, and burned as anyone else would</I>. 
<P>
     Your readers have the right to know that. 
<P>
     You have an obligation to tell them.
<P>
     But <I>will</I> you tell them?
<P>
     <I>That</I> is what I want to know. 
<P>
     Please tell me. 
<P>
P.S.
<P>
     I started researching the subject of circumcision informally
about ten years ago after the shock of seeing a baby being
circumcised on television.
<P>
     I almost fainted.
<P>
     I didn't have to be Sigmund Freud to realize that,
regardless what anyone might say, no one who has seen what's done
to a baby when he's circumcised and how the baby reacts could
possibly be glad -- much less wish -- that anything that violent
and gruesome had been done to his own penis, and that anyone who
claims otherwise -- for whatever reason -- has to be either lying
or in a state of denial.
<P>
     <I>Circumcision: The Painful Dilemma</I>, by Rosemary Romberg,
contains this statement by a circumcised man: "My early
recollection around the age of four years was that something was
missing -- and with it an intense feeling of loss coupled with a
complete lack of understanding as to what had happened. The
overwhelming feeling was not that I was simply different, but
that something was terribly wrong." (p. 194) 
<P>
     A couple of years ago on <I>Donahue</I>, a woman referred to her
circumcised son as a "basket case." Another woman described
various morbid symptoms her son had, caused by circumcision. One
man talked about his own circumcision-related sexual dysfunction.
Marilyn Milos, RN, founder and director of NOCIRC, said on that
show that she has received thousands of letters from circumcised
men with all sorts of circumcision-related problems.
<P>
     A NOCIRC newsletter reported that that organization has
received more than 1,000 requests for information about "foreskin
restoration." 
<P>
     Billy Boyd, author of <I>Circumcision: What It Does</I>, tells
about the pain he felt when a woman he was attracted to told him
that she preferred uncircumcised men. 
<P>
     The classified section of Issue Number 12 of <I>Foreskin
Quarterly</I> contains more than 100 ads placed by circumcised men
looking for uncircumcised men. 
<P>
     Another magazine, <I>Skins</I>, is filled with similar ads. 
<P>
     (What goes on in a male's mind between the time he realizes
that his foreskin was cut off when he was a baby and the time he
places an ad in the hope of finding a man whose foreskin he can
share?) 
<P>
     I have seen several photographs of and articles about
"docking" (two males masturbating inside one male's foreskin) in
gay magazines.
<P>
     A circumcised heterosexual man told me he'd like to try it
just to see how a foreskin feels.
<P>
     Dozens of men I've talked with have expressed various
degrees of discontent about having been circumcised without their
consent (regardless of any "benefits" -- they'd rather have a
foreskin and take their chances). 
<P>
     A man in his seventies told me that finding out, when he was
nine, that he was circumcised and what that meant, was the most
traumatic experience of his life, that he never got over it, and
that he felt so humiliated when he realized what had been done to
him that he could not refer to it, even to his parents, or make
himself say the word "circumcised" until he was in his twenties. 
<P>
     Several men circumcised as adults have told me that they
would never have had themselves circumcised if they had known
what being circumcised was like. 
<P>
     (On the <I>NOCIRC Circumcision Video</I>, a man circumcised as an
adult describes sex without a foreskin as "sight without color.") 
<P>
     A friend of mine recently died of AIDS. He told me several
years ago that the only reason he was gay was that he was
circumcised when he was a baby and felt deprived -- it was only
with an uncircumcised man that he could "have" a foreskin. 
<P>
     An uncircumcised male prostitute in New Orleans told me that
many of his customers were circumcised males who were turned on
by his foreskin.
<P>
     A man here on the Gulf Coast, whose mother had him
circumcised when he was a year old, told me that he thinks about
his mother with her ears docked, like a Doberman's, face
down in her coffin, facing hell.
<P>
     One circumcised man I talked with told me that when he
thought about what his parents let happen to him, he wanted to
"take a razor and slit their throats." 
<P>
     Another man told me he wanted to kill the doctor who
circumcised him.
<P>
     On the other hand, virtually every intact man I've talked
with told me he wouldn't want to be circumcised <I>for any reason
whatsoever</I>.
<P>
     Did someone say it's OK to circumcise babies for "religious"
reasons?
<P>
     Some of the ways circumcision has affected the lives of some
males I've encountered circumcised for religious reasons are so
extreme that I could not comfortably sign my name to a letter in
which I related them. 
<P>
     (I wonder how many Jewish women would let their baby sons be
circumcised if they knew how many circumcised Jewish males go
through life psychosexually enslaved to foreskins.)
<P>
     One man told me about a Jewish friend of his who travels to
Germany and pays uncircumcised neo-Nazi street punks -- they
<I>must</I> be uncircumcised -- to urinate in his face and call him
dirty names while he kneels before them and masturbates.
<P>
     Yes -- these examples are "just anecdotal."
<P>
     But <I>why</I> are they just anecdotal?
<P>
     If I, with my limited experience and resources, am aware of
these ways circumcision can affect a child's life, why aren't sex
researchers, sex educators, sex psychologists, sex counselors,
sex therapists, and the experts parents trust to give them the
facts about circumcision, also aware of them?
<P>
     If they <I>are</I> aware of these ways circumcision can affect a
child's life, why don't they speak up and help bring all this
torment and suffering to an end? 
<P>
     (Is it because the circumcision experience -- the operation
itself and later the realization that the one thing most males
fear most -- losing their penis or any part of it -- <I>has
already happened to them</I> -- is so traumatic for most circumcised
males that they just can't face it -- much less accept or
acknowledge it -- and the only way they can deal with it -- the
closest they can come to seeming "normal" -- is for as many other
males as possible to be circumcised too, and so circumcision is
perpetuated from one generation to the next as circumcised males
make sure that their sons -- and as many other males as possible
-- are circumcised too?)
<P>
     (If true, shouldn't <I>that</I> be made known?)
<P>
     The great difficulty, it seems to me -- and the main reason
babies are still being circumcised -- is that there is apparently
no way to make <I>mothers</I> aware of the facts about circumcision
that would make them refuse <I>absolutely</I> to let their baby sons
be circumcised -- <I>regardless how strongly the circumcised father
or anyone else insisted on it</I> -- without exposing the
circumcised father and any sons already circumcised as victims of
a physically and psychologically crippling, disfiguring
mutilation.
<P>
     But I digress.
<P>
     I await your reply.
<P>
[No answer received. However, if I remember correctly, a few months
later <I>Parents Magazine</I> mentioned -- I don't remember the 
context -- that babies do feel pain when they are circumcised.]
