I am 43 years old and was circumcised in a San Antonio, TX, 
Air Force hospital when I was a baby. I am very angry and bitter 
about this. It has caused me physical, psychological, and emotional 
problems all my life. I've lost the natural lubrication of the glans 
as well as protection for this most sensitive area. I have an ugly 
brown 3/8-inch-thick scar all around my penis and far too much skin 
was removed.

<P>On my 40th birthday I told my mother how I felt about this. She was
shocked. She apologized and said the doctors coerced her and my 
father into consenting. My father is 79 and intact.

<P>I first realized something was wrong with my penis when I was about
10 years old. I was skinny-dipping in a pond on a farm in Louisiana 
with several of the local farm boys about my age when they all began
to laugh at my penis because it was cut and no skin covered the glans. 
I felt ashamed and humiliated and ran home and told my mother. She 
said the doctors cut me for "hygienic reasons."

<P>When I was about 20, when some friends and I were getting "loose" at
a party, the American girlfriend of a friend of mine from Norway was 
giving his ong foreskin lots of attention and rolling it back and
forth over the glans. I realized then that my penis was missing 
something I could never have.

<P>Several years later I read an article in a popular men's magazine that
exposed and blasted the myths about circumcision. I told myself then 
that if I ever had a son, I'd make sure he wasn't circumcised. My
first son was born in 1980 and my second in 1981. I refused to even 
discuss circumcision with the doctors. I stayed near the nursery all 
night to make sure they weren't circumcised "by accident."

<P>But lightning struck twice for me! I was divorced in 1986 and my 
ex-wife took my sons to another state. In 1988 my older son called 
and told me he had been circumcised under general anesthesia at the
children's hospital. "Emergency surgery" for a minor infection of the 
glans! I almost had a breakdown. I was never even consulted. That's 
when I became active in anti-circumcision groups such as NOCIRC. My 
younger son remains happily intact.

<P>In 1991 I joined BUFF and NORM (National Organization of Restoring
Men) and began non-surgical foreskin restoration. I am very pleased 
with the results. I have more sensitivity in the glans and sex
is better now.

<P>But I should never have had to go through all this! This is child 
sexual abuse! No one had the right to cut my foreskin off! Not
for religion, social custom, "medical benefits," or any other reason.

<P>I won't rest until there are laws that protect baby boys from this
barbaric and senseless mutilation.

<P>[Yes, stories like this are "just anecdotal." But why are they just 
anecdotal?]
