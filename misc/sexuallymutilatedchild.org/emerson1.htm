<P>Dear Misters Fanning and Sullivan,

<P>I have a story idea for you. As you might know, on Friday, 15 January 1999
ABC News did about a 15 minute segment in their <I>20/20</I> TV show on infant
circumcision in the US. What <I>20/20</I> actually covered and presented was bad,
incomplete, misinformative and deceptive since they failed to reveal to the
US public the notable human rights violation of this senseless, violent,
<I>in fact</I> medically contraindicated, involuntary, non-therapeutic,
unethical, nature-insulting, degrading, humiliating, destructive,
mutilating, and lifelong harmful surgery, and <I>20/20</I> failed to interview any
of the growing number of angry, damaged, and disgusted US born men who were
forced in infancy to undergo this horrendous and anti-human practice posing
as medicine and still presented as medicine to an unsuspecting, unaware and
controlled US population.

<P>The US medical industry for the past 130 years has been removing part or
all of the external sex organs of children of both sexes. This is a great
shame and disgrace of US medicine. Eighty-five percent of the world’s males
have normal, natural intact penis, but 85% to 90% of US born men were
forced to have for life a partial, man-damaged, desexualized, emasculated
primary sex organ. I ask <I>Frontline</I> to investigate the history and
continuing deception, fraud, absence of ethics and greed in the US medical
industry on this matter.

<P>Though still inflicted/performed on 60% of US born baby boys (down from a
high of 90% in the ‘80’s, but still 90% or more in large areas of the US),
this surgery permanently damages the penis, and guarantees sexual
dysfunction (of a physical/mechanical nature) and limits, controls,
restricts and damages male sexual pleasure. The denial of the harm, the
lying that goes on in US medicine, and the fear of both the shocking
history and the sexual, medical, physical, emotional, psychological and
self-esteem forms of harm done to boys and men by infant circumcision keep
this horrendous practice alive (along with all the myths, notions,
superstition (religion), homophobia and psychopathology surrounding this
abusive sexual perversion inflicted on the helpless).

<P>The entire US medical database on infant circumcision has been corrupted
due to: 1) the appalling ignorance of US doctors and the failure of US
medical schools to present and teach what is known in the world medical
literature on the value of whole sex organs, on the damage done by genital
surgery inflicted on unconsenting, healthy children, and on the effective,
non-surgical treatments for the rare to uncommon foreskin problem, 2) the
fear of the anger of parents, men, and the religionists whose perversion is
protected by the so-called medical infant circumcision. (Incidentally,
there are Jews angry at having been sexually mutilated at birth, and Jews
have long been writing important books and articles against infant
circumcision. Semitic fundamentalists have successfully crushed in the past
the noble efforts to end this atrocity and fraud inflicted on helpless
boys.), and 3) the desire to protect US MD’s and hospitals from lawsuits
that would result if the public knew the truth about this shame and 
disgrace of infant circumcision sexual mutilation, the stigma of a sick, 
violent, religion-damaged US.

<P>Since the US medical database has been corrupted, the best source for
information on this problem is the Internet. Here are some websites that
offer the best information on this awful problem. I’ve added the names and
phone numbers of experts you should contact and interview:

<P>The American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP] will around 1 March 1999 
release a
new position and policy statement on infant circumcision surgery. It’s felt
that due to the shamefulness and the great control of this evil and
lifelong harmful practice, due to the psychopathology ensured by this
problem, due to the loss -- for MD’s and hospitals -- of between 500 and 800
million dollars per year in the US, and due to the fear of lawsuits from
the US public, the AAP will not condemn this surgery, claiming, once again,
possible medical "benefits".

<P>The US public deserves a proper examination of this shame and disgrace of
US medicine. Please examine a copy of what <I>20/20</I> presented so that you do
not make the same mistakes and failures of presentation that they did
recently.

<P>I and other Americans respect what <I>Frontline</I> has done to reveal
fraud, deception and shocking practices in government, business, and
medicine. Please continue this excellence by presenting a more than one
hour program on this problem of medically contraindicated and unethical --
yet inflicted/performed -- infant circumcision surgery.

<P>Sincerely yours,
