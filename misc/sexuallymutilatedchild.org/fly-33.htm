<blockquote>
Includes <b>The Three Zones of Penile Skin</b>, five photographs
showing the foreskin at various stages of retraction with
lines drawn where the foreskin begins on the shaft and at
the mucocutaneous junction to show the amount of total
penile skin -- more than half -- that is foreskin. Brief
text.

<P>
      "What an amazing collection of images!"
<P>
      "Today I received your wonderful photos and, indeed,
they are incredible."
<P>
      "Fantastic."
<P>
      Super fabulous!"
<P>
      "Thank you for the photographs. I have looked through
them and studied them several times -- with great
fascination! I feel as though I am being introduced to a
whole different world of male anatomy, and I now realize how
much of it I really have not understood. An uncircumcised
penis is so much more than just 'a little extra skin' -- it
is a different landscape of folds of skin, texture, moisture
and sensitivity."
<P>
      "I am enthralled by your beautiful images of what can
never be brought back to life for me."
<P>
      "Your photographs are a beautiful and refreshing
reminder of the glories that await Americans if only they
would wake up."
<P>
      "Unique. Even as an uncircumcised male I learned
something from them. Until I saw your photos of the marked
foreskin [The Three Zones of Penile Skin], I never realized that
the foreskin, when fully retracted, actually extends into the
pubic hair and almost to the base of the penis. Nor did I
appreciate that the tip of the foreskin, when retracted fully,
actually extends almost to the middle of the length of the erect
penis."
<P>
      "I was expecting to see a piece of post-operative,
unattached foreskin." [After receiving this letter, I added
the word "Intact" to the name of the exhibit and photo set.]
<P>
      "Can be very effective in educating circumcised men
about the structure of the foreskin (a marvel of design) and
frenulum and the complex but extremely effective manner in
which it stimulates the glans, and in turn receives
stimulation, as well as provides a sleeve for effective
intromission in intercourse."
<P>
      "Your photos should help me in instructing my son in
his responsibilities in the care of himself as he grows
older."
<P>
      "Very clear ... high quality definition ... an
invaluable visual aid in seminars."
<P>
      "Thank you for making available your informative set
of photographs exhibited at the Third International
Symposium on Circumcision. As a pediatrician who is trying
to dissuade as many prospective parents as possible from
circumcising their yet unborn sons, I have difficulty
getting across the message about how much skin is lost and
about the elasticity of the foreskin. Virtually every father
who needs to be convinced that routine infant circumcision
is unnecessary was himself circumcised as an infant and
cannot relate to the functions of a foreskin. Most mothers
are just as uninformed. Trying to get the message across
from line drawings has been difficult. Your excellent
photographs will help." (MD)

      "I can sure use your photographs!" (MD)

Some of these photographs have been printed in black-and-white 
in <i>Sexual Mutilations: A Human Tragedy (Procedings of the Fourth 
International Symposium on Circumcision, Lausanne, Switzerland, 
August 9-11, 1996)</i>, edited by George C. Denniston, MD, and Marilyn 
Fayre Milos, RN (Plenum, 1997).

<P>The five photographs that comprise the subset, <i>The Three
Zones of Penile Skin</i>, have been reproduced in <i>Awakenings: A 
Preliminary Poll of Circumcised Men (Revealing the Long-Term Harm of 
Healing the Wounds of Infant Circumcision) (NOHARMM, 1994)</i> and the 
November 1995 issue of the Montreal newspaper, <i>Le Presse</i>.

<p>Attorney David Llewellyn (Atlanta Circumcision Information Center)
told me that these five photographs helped the jury arrive at their 
verdict in the successful wrongful circumcision lawsuit in Birmingham, 
Alabama, 1995, in which he was attorney for the plaintiff.

<P><b>Please note</b>:
<br>I have no photographs of children or for children and don't
know or want to know anyone who does. If you are looking for
photographs showing the genitals of children, try Sing Sing or
San Quentin.
