<blockquote>

Jacob Sweet was born at PROVIDENCE HOSPITAL in Anchorage on
January 16, 1986. He was a healthy and normal baby boy. On
January 17, 1986, Jacob was circumcised by JAMES NESBITT, M.D.,
of THE CHILDREN'S CLINIC. On Saturday, January 25, Jacob's
parents, Gary and Beverly Sweet, brought Jacob back to the
emergency room at PROVIDENCE because he was vomiting and was
fussy and the circumcision side was red and swollen. They were
met by DANIEL TULIP, M.D., also of THE CHILDREN'S CLINIC. DR.
TULIP admitted Jacob to the hospital. Late in the evening of
January 26, Jacob suffered a prolonged seizure or "crash" and was
transferred to the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit at
2:15 a.m. on Monday, January 27.

<P>Today, Jacob is nine years old and is severely brain damaged. He
cannot walk, talk or care for himself in any respect.

<P>SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT PORTIONS OF JACOB'S PROVIDENCE
HOSPITAL MEDICAL RECORDS FOR THE 26-HOUR PERIOD FROM THE TIME HE
WAS ADMITTED UNTIL THE "CRASH" ARE MISSING.

<P>The attorneys for the Sweets, listed below, believe that there
are persons with knowledge of how records may have become "lost"
and would like to speak to anyone with any knowledge regarding
Jacob or his "lost" records...

<P>We understand that you may feel pressured not to come forward.
All we ask is your complete honesty and your assistance in a
matter of extreme importance, not only for Jacob and his family,
but also for the medical care of future patients... Payment of
all or a portion of the reward is in the good faith discretion of
Jacob's attorneys who assure you that you will be treated fairly.
