QUESTIONING CIRCUMCISION: A JEWISH PERSPECTIVE is the first critical examination of the
growing controversy of male infant circumcision with special attention to contemporary concerns of the
Jewish community. Endorsed by five rabbis, this extraordinary book examines the origins, assumed
benefits, risks, and unrecognized consequences of the Jewish practice with thorough documentation and
moving personal experiences.
<dl>
<dt>Consider these facts: 
<dd>     Circumcision is not universal among Jews. 
<dd>     Jewish press articles have questioned circumcision. 
<dd>     A male child born of a Jewish mother is a Jew, whether he is circumcised or not. 
<dd>     Jewish circumcision has never had anything to do with health concerns. 
<dd>     Circumcision conflicts with significant Jewish laws and values. 
<dd>     An Israeli organization publicly opposes circumcision.

<blockquote>
     "Dr. Goldman has written a thoughtful, provocative book on a difficult subject. He challenges us to
reexamine long-held assumptions and to reconsider the practice of milah (ritual circumcision) in light of
contemporary evidence. By giving us an insightful and carefully documented exploration of a controversial
perspective, Dr. Goldman helps to foster a healthy and valuable dialogue within the Jewish community."
RABBI JONATHAN KRAUS, Beth El Temple Center

     "I highly recommend Questioning Circumcision: A Jewish Perspective particularly to expectant
mothers and fathers early in their pregnancy so that they may have ample time to ponder its contents. I also
recommend it to rabbis who counsel on the merits of circumcision, so they can offer a more informed
perspective on this ritual." RABBI RAYMOND SINGER, PH.D., neuropsychologist

     "If you are a liberal Jew, whether you see circumcision as the sanctification of the covenant, as a
ceremony marking you as a Jew, or otherwise, this book stimulates deeper reflection about the practice. As
an aware, concerned, and introspective people, Jews must examine whether our rites are right. We must
determine if our ceremonies, traditions, and practices reflect our innermost beliefs. Asking ourselves and
each other the question 'Why?' is one of the most sacred tasks to which a modern Jew can dedicate himself
or herself." RABBI DONALD POLLOCK, pastoral psychotherapist, writer, and lecturer
