<h3>Report from Richard DeSeabra, NYC 
<br>Dec. 27, 1995 (INTACT-L email group)</h3></center>

<BR>

On Dec. 24th I got a call from an anonymous
intactivist who went by the name of BABY BOY. He
chose to identify himself that way because that's how
he was referred to on his circumcision consent form:
BABY BOY plus his last name. I told him that on my
circumcision consent form I was called Baby Boy
DeSeabra for I was not yet named. He told me he
was on his way to New York Hospital where he was
born over 20 years ago to stop a circumcision and
chain himself to the circumcision room door. I told him
to please, whatever he did, abide by non-violent, civil
disobedient guidelines: Don't destroy any property,
Don't hurt anyone, etc. I was at my computer both
times he called and I paraphrased information into the
computer as he spoke. Here is a summary of what
BABY BOY told me: 

<P>"I left the house at 2 PM and went to New
York Hospital, Cornell University. Asked around and
found N3, the section of the building where the
nursery was. Went to the nurses desk and told them it
meant a lot to me to see where I was born. Asked for
a tour around to see but they wouldn't cooperate. I
asked what birth was like at that hospital.  Didn't
your parents tell you?  the nurses asked. I insisted and
said I wanted some images to associate with my birth.
One nurse described how they assist in births. Then I
asked what the difference was between the care given
to boys and girls and a nurse caught on and asked,
 Do you mean circumcision?  She explained that
parental consent was required. Then I asked a female
doctor or nurse dressed in blue where the circumcision
room was. I proceeded against their wishes to look
around. I saw an Olympic Circumstraint and asked
about it. They wouldn't admit what it was used for or
how it was used. Then the nurses said that I shouldn't
be talking with them, I should be talking to their
superiors. One nurse said she was going to call
security. Another said, I already have.  As I pointed to
them I said,  I'll be back.  I went downstairs
zig-zagging through the building till I was outside.
Went back in and asked a guard for the Bio-Ethics
department. Another guard came by and made sure the
guard took me to security headquarters where they
warned me not to trespass again saying they would
call the 19th precinct."

<P>Day Two. Dec. 26. BABY BOY called again:
"First I made a series of phone calls to talk to
someone in Bio-Ethics. Got the usual run-around. At
3:30 PM went to New York Hospital's 9th floor to
talk to Dr. David Ninemburg of Pediatric Urology. I
was redirected to Patients Services where a woman
gave me the name of the president of the hospital and
suggested I write a letter. Since I had said two days
earlier that I'd be back, I went back to N3, looked
around, and the Circumstraint I had seen was no
longer there. Looked through another window in the
wall and saw it. I told two women (probably visitors)
who were watching babies that I was going to take
the Circumstraint and that circumcision was torture.
One agreed that it was extremely painful because a
clamp was put on the penis and she said that the
Jews do it in a few seconds. I told her it is still a
violation of the baby's rights even if it is done quickly.
Then I stood by the window to the room where the
Circumstraint was. A nurse was near a crying baby
girl with a clamp on her umbilical cord. I knocked and
a young nurse opened the door. I said,  I'm taking
that,  pointing to the Circumstraint. I reached over,
picked it up from underneath some stuff.  Why are you
taking it?  she asked.  Because it is a form of torture, 
I replied. I left with it and entered the first elevator,
went downstairs, ran through some hallways to the
main entrance, held it up in the air as I yelled,  I got
it, you f---heads,  and ran out the door smiling and ran
for blocks until I stopped." 

<P>BABY BOY told me he felt great about doing
it and that he was going to take it back to his
university, show it to his friends and burn it. I told
him that what he now had in his hands is one of the
most powerful tools of education about genital
mutilation and that he should not destroy it. When
destroying a Circumstraint you are but destroying one
Circumstraint. When you SHOW the Circumstraint to
people, you are destroying circumcision. The
Circumstraint speaks for itself and is obviously sick
and wrong. BABY BOY told me that he had done this
two days from the anniversary of his circumcision. He
said it was restoration day for him. I hailed him for
his courage and then played devil's advocate by
questioning the fact that property was stolen and that
this may well be the first act sabotage against the
circumcision industry. He told me,  Fine, I did steal
something from them but they stole something from
me 20 years ago.  I couldn't agree more and it should
go without saying that the Circumstraint New York
Hospital had stolen from them that day can be
replaced for $168. What was stolen from BABY BOY
twenty years ago can't be replaced. I really admire
this young man's courage and energy. The energy of
the college student is one that the various pro-intact
movements are yet to tap into. I must confess that if
I had been aware of my mutilation during my college
years, I wouldn't have spent so much energy
protesting the installation of Cruise missiles in Europe.
I certainly would have been as militant as BABY BOY.
This act can be regarded as a landmark in the fight
against genital mutilation. I offer this story that came
to me as an anonymous phone call not as a praising
of one man's actions but as a moment of reflection
and debate as to how we should proceed, or better,
how some should choose to proceed and network
among themselves. What do all of you think? The
intactivist politician that I have become in the past
year can't condone this kind of action. But I must
confess, my heart is giggling. 

<P>PS: Just for the sake of semantics: Some
intactivists may want to see this as a case in which a
Circumstraint was retired, not stolen.
