To <B>Pediatrics</B> (8/31/84):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is one category of men circumcised in infancy that
most books, articles, and studies about circumcision don't
mention and whose existence most experts have not yet
acknowledged: men who see themselves as victims of a
mutilation but are silenced by humiliation, who would rather
have their foreskins intact but cannot face the added
humiliation of calling attention to the fact that part of
their penis has been cut off.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They often think they are alone, and pretend contentment
or indifference to save face, unaware that there are other
circumcised men who have the same feelings and are pretending
too.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because they keep their thoughts and feelings to
themselves, they are easy to be unaware of -- and easy to
ignore.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That's one of the reasons circumcision can seem so
harmless -- you rarely hear from or about the babies it
eventually hurts the most.

<p>To <B>Forum</B> (published in an early 1984 issue):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In his letter, "Circumcision Debate," in your October
issue, Mr. P.G. states that "it would seem that men prefer to
be circumcised."

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What men?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
According to <I>Circumcision: An American Health Fallacy</I>,
by Edward Wallerstein, the circumcision rate among
uncircumcised adult males in the U.S., where four out of five
male babies are circumcised, is less than 1 in 100.  In
countries where babies are not circumcised, adult circumcision
is rarer still. Wallerstein estimates that the adult
circumcision rate in Finland, for instance, is less than 1 in
15,000.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Clearly, <I>un</I>circumcised men prefer to remain
uncircumcised.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Perhaps Mr. P.G. means that <I>cir</I>cumcised men prefer to
be circumcised.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But do they?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The apparent contentment of men with their circumcised
state is often an illusion. Many circumcised men live with two
secret fears: that they are sexually impaired and that they
will be <I>exposed</I> as sexually impaired.  As they become aware of
the facts about the foreskin and circumcision, their fear that
they are impaired is confirmed. As they realize that others
are becoming aware of the same facts, their fear that they
will be exposed as impaired comes true. The result is often a
paralyzing mixture of feelings few men would care to
acknowledge: shock, humiliation, anxiety, frustration,
anguish, bitterness, resentment, rage, depression, despair,
and envy of males whose foreskins are intact.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's not that men prefer to be circumcised; it's just
that once they are, they often keep their real thoughts and
feelings about it to themselves and pretend contentment or
indifference in an attempt to make the best of it.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. P.G. is very lucky to be glad he has no foreskin. 
Millions of circumcised American men aren't.

<P>To <B>Ann Landers</B> (6/8/82):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The list of infant circumcision risks in your book, <I>The
Ann Landers Encyclopedia</I>, doesn't mention what is perhaps the
likeliest risk of all -- the one risk that makes the so-called
"benefits" of circumcision irrelevant.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I refer to the paralyzing horror and crushing
humiliation some children feel -- and then secretly live 
with -- when they realize that part of their penis has been
cut off.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A few years ago on television, David Susskind asked you
if you had some last advice, some parting counsel, some final
message for the world.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I remember your answer. You said, "Be kind."
