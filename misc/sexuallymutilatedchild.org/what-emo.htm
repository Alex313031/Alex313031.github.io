<P>Throughout His Life?"</center></h2>

To <B>The Saturday Evening Post</B> (7/9/82):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The two articles about infant circumcision in your
December issue mention the possibility of "emotional harm"
and "deleterious effects on the male psyche, affecting a
child throughout his life."

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What emotional harm? What deleterious effects?
Affecting him how?

<P>To <B>Ladies' Home Journal</B> (<B>"Innocence for Sale,"</B> April 1983) (5/24/83):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If it's true, as your article states, that abused
children often become child abusers, what about children who
are strapped down and have part of their genitals cut off --
what do they become?

<P>To <B>American Health</B> (<B>"Circumcision: A Cut Too Many?,"</B> Sept.
1984) (8/27/84):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One of the reasons your article gives for circumcising
babies is to keep them from feeling different in the locker
room.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But after the baby has been circumcised and has no
foreskin, and then later sees males who have chosen to keep
that part of their penis that was cut from his without his
consent -- what does he feel then?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What <I>should</I> he feel?

<P>To <B>Foreskin Quarterly</B> (5/1/87):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I notice that many of the classified ads in <B>Foreskin
Quarterly</b> are placed by men who designate themselves as
circumcised but who are looking specifically for men who are
not circumcised.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What goes on in a male's mind between the time he
realizes that his foreskin was cut off when he was a baby
and the time he places an ad in the hope of finding a man
whose foreskin he can share?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That information is not included in any of the
literature I've seen that claims to give parents the
information they need in order to make an informed choice
about having a newborn son's foreskin amputated or letting 
him keep it intact.

<P>To <B>Surgeon General Koop</B> (11/24/87):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In your letter about circumcision in the July-August
1982 issue of <B>The Saturday Evening Post</B>, you mention
"psychological problems that do occur in families with two
little boys, one of whom is circumcised and one of whom is
not."

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What psychological problems? For whom? The circumcised
boy? The intact boy?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If problems occur in <I>families</I> in which one <I>boy</I> has all
of his penis and one boy doesn't, what problems must occur
in <I>societies</I> in which some <I>men</I> have all of their penis and
some men don't?
