"A piece of skin the size of a quarter
contains more than three million cells, 12 feet of
nerves, 100 sweat glands, 50 nerve endings, and
almost three feet of blood vessels." <small><b><I>(The Human
Connection</I>, by Ashley Montagu and Floyd
Matson, McGraw-Hill, 1979)</b></small>

equivalent to a 3 x 5 index card." <b><small><I>(Say No to

<p>"The prepuce is much more complex
than the simple fold of skin described in
textbooks. Its inner, mucosal surface contains a
tightly pleated zone, near the tip, rich in nerve
endings, particularly large mucocutaneous end-
organs that are also described in the glans ... 
the prepuce is specialized junctional tissue with a
special sensory function." <b><small>("The Prepuce: What,
Exactly, Is Removed by Circumcision?," by John
Taylor, M.B., FASC, <I>Syllabus of Abstracts

<P>"With its high density of nerve endings,
its rich blood supply, its muscle fibers which
give both skin tone and shape to its structure, the
foreskin is as unique as other  skin  organs such
as the scrotum or the eyelids. As for receptor
nerves, the frenulum (the web of tissue on the
underside of the penis which helps to hold the
foreskin forward over the glans, particularly
when the penis is flaccid) is exceedingly rich in
nerve endings ... The first advantage [of the intact
penis] is, of course, the actual sensual sensations
from the nerve endings within the foreskin itself 
... These delightful sensations are the major
source of pleasure during the earlier, foreplay
phase of sexual arousal. As sexual arousal
continues, the inner lining of the foreskin and the
glans itself become increasingly exposed and
responsive to stimulation." <b><small><I>(The Joy of
Uncircumcising! Restore Your
Birthright and Maximize Sexual
Pleasure</I>, by Jim Bigelow, PhD, Hourglass

<P>"Much of the primary erotic stimulus
comes from the skin ... two types of erogenous
zones exist in the skin: nonspecific and specific 
... the nonspecific regions perceive simply an
exaggerated form of tickle ... it is the specific
regions when one speaks of erotic sensations
originating in the skin. The specific type of
erogenous zones are found in the mucocutaneous
regions which include the prepuce. This anatomy
favors acute perceptions. The rete ridges are well
formed and more of the organized nerve tissue
rises higher (than in other skin-type regions). In
the prepuce the mucocutaneous end-organs
extend from the distal margin (tip) of the prepuce
(down) to the site (on the shaft) at which the
hairy skin begins, where they diminish and
disappear." <b><small><I>(The Erogenous Zones: Their Nerve

<P>"Anatomical studies demonstrate that the
foreskin has a greater concentration of complex
nerve endings than the glans." <B><small>("The Female Patient," 
by George Denniston, MD, MPH, July 1992.)</small></b>

<P>"The prepuce is a highly enervated and
vascularized genital structure. It is entirely lined
with the peripenic muscle sheet. Specialized
ectopic sebaceous glands on the inner preputial
surface produce natural emollients and lubricants
necessary for normal sexual function. The
primary orgasmic triggers are found in the
preputial orifice and frenulum. When unfolded,
the prepuce is large enough to cover the length
and circumference of the erect penis and acts as a
natural sheath through which the shaft glides
during coitus. Only the presence and functions of
the prepuce allow for physiologically normal
coitus to occur as designed by nature." <B><small>(Paul M.
