The following excerpts are taken from messages about the
foreskin, circumcision, circumcisers, and foreskin restoration
posted during 1995, 1996, and 1997 in the various newsgroups
listed earlier in this section and in America Online's discussion
group "Religion / Judaism."
<P>
...Cutting a baby is OK, but the real thrill is doing it for an
adolescent, and because there are fewer babies done, it means
there are more teenagers around to play with ... since I left
the Army, I have had the privilege and pleasure of taking my
scalpel to some 25 or 30 healthy teenagers' foreskins.
<P>
...Always my fetish, to bind a guy down and circumcise him. Like
to have guys watch as I trim a hood back to the balls. The
foreskin my trophy for my collection. Any uncuts ready to become
cut? I want to circumcise your foreskins using my Tara Klamps.
<P>
...I got circumcised when I was 19 years old, and I've regretted
it ever since! ... I felt like someone had poured gasoline on
my dick and set it on fire ... I lost the glorious sensitivity
my glans used to have ... my beautiful, long, flexible, fun
foreskin is gone forever.
<P>
...<I>Nothing</I> will bring back those nerves.
<P>
...I now have to masturbate using a catcher's mitt and 00-grade
steel wool.
<P>
...I have been penetrated a few times by people who are
not whole and each time I feel the uncomfortable feeling of too
much friction, it does not happen with a man that has an intact
penis, as a result I will not let anyone who is circumcised screw
me.
<P>
...The foreskin is a wonderful toy that I only get to play with
by proxy now.
<P>
...I always wondered why women seemed so much more naturally
sensitive until it finally dawned on me that I was born equally
sensitive, but they cut it off.
<P>
...The woman I was most in love with had a thing for uncut ...
<P>
...Some guys have a foreskin. I just got the shaft.
<P>
...I wish I had my phimosis back.
<P>
...I found circumcision MUCH worse than merely being gang raped
as a 6 year old.
<P>
...I never realized so much was involved with circumcision.
Honestly, to this day, I don't even know if I was circumcised,
and I am an old man. I'm afraid to find out! Perhaps it's better
not to know that one has missed a lifetime of sexual pleasure!
<P>
...I share in the outrage of those comments listed in this
message. What can we do to regain that which is not possible to
regain? How can we undo that which is undoable? I feel like my
life is over, I feel incomplete and betrayed by this society that
has done this to me and so many others. We have been deprived of
our potential, made less than we could have been. How much more
cruel is this than being put to death? I think death is a better
sentence.
<P>
...As a young child I recall being morbidly horrified by seeing
an adult with an amputated lower arm. I have always had the same
feelings whenever seeing a mutilated person including discovering
that other children had a lumpy scar where I had normal skin.
<P>
...The foreskin is nature at its best.
<P>
...I would get into a serious depression if I ever lost it.
<P>
...I have been cut my entire life. Sex has been great for me. You
don't have to keep retracting your foreskin when you put on a
condom.
<P>
...It is very interesting and amusing to read the strange ideas
that circumcised men have about normal human anatomy.
<P>
...I don't see why Jewish boys [like me] should be less protected
against genital mutilation because of their religion or that of
their parents. To me that is Anti-semitic.
<P>
...I am an observant Jew, born of two Jewish parents, and I am
not circumcised ... [My mother] said she did not survive such
horrors [the Holocaust] only to believe that knives, blood and
unnecessary pain should be visited upon her children ... why
should she listen to a man (Abraham) who was willing to kill his
child ... My sons, who are also observant Jews, are not
circumcised and they do not plan to circumcise their sons. Are
there any other uncircumcised Jewish men who are willing to come
out on line?
<P>
...I think that parents who subject their sons to the
consequences of not circumcising should be shot. 
<P>
..."We do it because we do, and that's sufficient"??? ... 
Adolph Hitler could have said the same thing about his treatment
of the Jews.
<P>
...I am another Jew who finds circumcision abhorrent and I am so
glad to find ... that I am not the only one ... I am a good
mother ... I could find no support in the Jewish
community ... I was treated abominably ... I brissed my boy
and it was the worst day of our lives because of the incredible
conflict I feel ... I find your lack of sensitivity appalling,
all of you. The issue of consent is valid.
<P>
...I am saddened and disgusted with the very vocal closed-minds
who have taken over this discussion. Ritual circumcision has no
medical reasons and is communal ritualized incest and sexual
abuse of an innocent baby. Anyone who cannot see that clear and
simple fact has a mind that, if they had been born into another
religion by accident of birth, would feel comfortable in the
fundamentalist Christian right or as an Islamic fundamentalist
(who believes bombing the infidel is the will of Allah) or (yes,
I will say it!) Nazi Party. I am glad you guys represent only a
small segment of Judaism--the segment that doggedly refuses to
think! Goodbye and I hope you end up sharing a cell with Islamic
fundamentalists who are as filled with hate and intolerance as
you guys are!!!
<P>
...Most, or all, circumcision done in the world today is done by
Americans ... Jewish people ... natives in the deep
jungle ... and other middle-Eastern people ... Strange
bedfellows ...
<P>
...Saying "uncircumcised" is like saying "unamputated" or
"unmutilated" or maybe "unstabbed-through-the-heart-and-gored-to-
death."
<P>
...There are Meissner nerves in the foreskin.
<P>
...More foreskins, please.
<P>
...Nothing has to be traumatic at all for a newborn. Nothing
should be allowed to be traumatic to a newborn.
<P>
...Having just finished a Ph.D. dissertation on Somali women's
reactions to their having been circumcised, I must disagree with
Ari, who said that the women come to be satisfied with their
condition ... Many of the women had initially wanted to be
circumcised so they could be like their peers, but they soon
wished otherwise.
<P>
...I am against male and female circumcisions, because both
customs are violating the physical integrity of a healthy, 
non-consenting child. Therefore, both are crimes.
<P>
...There should be a law making circumcision compulsory at
childbirth.
<P>
...If you want to see a <I>real</I> holocaust, just try making
circumcision compulsory by law.
<P>
...Circumcision will not be "over" until its last victim dies.
<P>
...Anyone interested in alt.sex.circumcision.pro-con?
<P>
...Where is the guy who started this folder???
