<br>

<B>To Dr. Ruth Westheimer, sex therapist</b> (9/5/86):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The other night on <I>Larry King Live</I>, when a woman
called in and said her vagina hurt after intercourse with
her husband, you advised her to see a doctor.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why did you assume something was wrong with <I>her</I>?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Isn't it possible -- even likely -- that the pain she
feels is the result of friction caused by the absence of a
slick, sensitive, self-lubricating, movable sheath of skin
-- a <i>foreskin</i> -- from the penis of her circumcised
husband?

<P>
<B>To Dr. Irene Kassorla, psychologist</B> (8/6/86):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Could there be a connection between the continually
recurring theme on men's "detective" magazine covers -- the
bound and gagged woman shrinking from a man with a knife --
and the fact that most men in this country had a similar
experience when they were babies, when someone restrained
them, ignored their screams, and cut part of their penises
off?

<P><b>To Gloria Steinem, feminist</B> (9/8/86):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Has anyone investigated the possibility of a
connection between all of the unnecessary amputations and
other unnecessary surgery performed on women in the U.S.
(Caesareans, episiotomies, hysterectomies, mastectomies,
etc.) and the fact that most of the doctors who perform
those operations are themselves the victims of an
unnecessary amputation: circumcision -- requested, consented
to, or allowed by their mothers?
