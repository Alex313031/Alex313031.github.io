<P>Dear Dr. Woodman:

<P>Thank you for your letter dated January 25, 2000. I had hoped you would 
take more than passing interest in my complaints concerning unnecessary 
surgery. I agree with you that you are unable to argue any benefits for 
unnecessary surgery. However, someone who does unnecessary surgery, teaches 
medical students to do unnecessary surgery, and publishes articles 
concerning how to most humanely do unnecessary surgery, cannot claim 
that he 
is not a proponent of unnecessary surgery. It is a blight on a major medical 
journal to present the fact that gynecologists commonly do unnecessary 
surgery; that patients do, indeed, feel pain; and that we, as physicians, 
should offer anesthetics. As human beings, we should, instead, make 
unnecessary surgery of non-consenting, protesting, tethered patients a 
transgression and avoid iatrogenic pain altogether.

<P>I disagree with you that there are "a few medical indications" for 
unnecessary surgery.  
I disagree that patients "choose to request" unnecessary surgery. My 
experience is that patients are pressured, that consent forms are slipped 
into packets of admission forms, and that the forms are often inadvertently 
signed while the patient is in crisis or under the influence of drugs.

<P>I am curious to know why a gynecologist, a woman's physician, feels 
compelled to offer, to teach, and to publish articles on amputating part 
of a male's normal sex organ. It is curious that the topic of unnecessary 
sexual surgery evokes the word "passionate" in your letter.

<P>Enclosed is an informed consent form for medically necessary sexual 
surgery. It is on the Internet at 
<A HREF="http://www.informedconsent.org/circumcision.html">
http://www.informedconsent.org/circumcision.html</A>. 
Feel free to use it in your own practice.  
No one has ever signed it. All I ask is that you let me know if anyone 
ever does.

<P>Thank you for wishing me luck in my "crusade." It is not I, however,
who 
plunders the treasures of my patients. Unnecessary surgery is not my 
religion. Thank you for informing me that you and Dr. Erickson 
[no relation to John A. Erickson]   
will continue 
perform and to teach unnecessary surgery. In the face of your willful 
defiance, it is my duty to document what you knew and when you knew it. To 
that end, I am sending your material to the Attorneys for the Rights of the 
Child, and I am placing your material on the Informed Consent.com Foundation 
working documents site. 

<P>I pray your work will quickly go the way of lobotomies, thymectomies, 
surreptitious sterilizations, the Tuskegee experiment, LSD experiments, and 
the plutonium files. You are proof that the medical community cannot police 
itself. You force the shortcomings of the medical profession into public 
forums. You force degrading legislation upon the medical profession. Until 
male genital mutilation is added to the Female Genital Mutilation Legislation 
and specifically prohibited by law as a felony, you amputate and you teach 
amputation under surveillance and at risk.

<P>Sincerely, 

<P>Eileen Marie Wayne, M.D.
