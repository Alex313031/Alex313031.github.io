<h2>Infant Circumcision:

<P>Foreskin Amputation by Force</h2></center>
 
<br>Why does so much information about circumcision miss the
point? 
<P>     
     The foreskin is a uniquely specialized, uniquely sensitive,
uniquely functional organ of touch. No other part of the body
does what a foreskin does or feels the way a foreskin feels. When
you cut off a baby's foreskin, you are cutting off one of his
means of perceiving, experiencing, sharing, and enjoying his
existence. When you cut off a baby's foreskin, you are literally
censoring his life -- you are, in fact, <I>killing</I> part of that
baby. 
<P>
     The vast majority of males who are given the choice value
their wholeness -- even beyond price -- and keep their foreskins
intact, for the same reason they keep their other organs of
perception intact. When you circumcise a baby, you are cutting
off a part of his penis that you <I>can</I> cut off only because the
person you're cutting it off of can't protect himself because he
<I>is</I> a baby. In other words, when you circumcise a baby, you are,
in effect, cutting his foreskin off by force.
<P>
     Many males circumcised as babies see themselves as harmed by
that amputation -- <I>regardless of the reason they were
circumcised</I> -- just as they would see themselves as harmed if any
other healthy, sensitive, normally functioning part of their
bodies had been cut off. 
<P>
     <I>The endlessly debated "health benefits" of circumcision are
therefore a false issue and would not justify depriving a baby of
his foreskin even if they were real</I>.
<P>
     (If someone restrains you -- at any age -- against your
will, ignores your screams, and -- with or without an
anesthetic -- cuts, tears, crushes, or burns living flesh from
your genitals without your consent -- consent not one person in a
hundred with the choice is, would be, or ever has been willing to
give -- how are you benefitted?)
<P>
     (By thinking -- or pretending to think -- you've been
benefitted?)
<P>
     If the experts parents trust to give them the facts about
circumcision aren't aware of the considerations outlined above,
why aren't they? If they <I>are</I> aware of those considerations, why
do they remain silent?
