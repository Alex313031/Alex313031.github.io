Summary of evidence that the foreskin and

<blockquote>
This file contains a summary of the evidence that the foreskin and the
sub-preputial wetness under the foreskin (prepuce) may protect
against human immunodeficiency virus.

<P>Lysozyme is an enzyme with anti-bacterial action that is found in body
fluids. (An enzyme is a protein or conjugated protein produced by a living
organism and functions as a biochemical catalyst.<SUP>1</SUP>) 
Lysozyme breaks down cell walls and kills bacteria.

<P> <A
HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/prakash/">Prakash and others</A>
reported in 1983 that sub-preputial wetness contains lysozyme<SUP>2</SUP>
and <A
HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/lee-huang/">Lee-Huang</A>
finds lysozyme in human urine.<SUP>3</SUP>  <A
HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/lee-huang/">Lee-Huang et 
al</A>.
report that lysozyme is also an effective agent for killing HIV <I>in
vitro</I>.<SUP>3</SUP>

<P> <A HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/laumann/">Laumann et
al</A>. report that about 77 percent of adult American males are
circumcised. <SUP>4</SUP>  Thus, these circumcised males have no
sub-preputial wetness and no lysozyme protection. Laumann finds that
circumcised men are slightly more likely to have both a bacterial and a
viral STD in their lifetime.<SUP>4</SUP>

<P> World Health Organization data show that the incidence of 
HIV infection in the United States is four or more times greater 
than in any other advanced industrial nation.<SUP>5</SUP>  Other
advanced nations either do not circumcise males or have a very low
incidence of circumcision compared to the United States.<SUP>6</SUP>

<P> <A
HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/chao/">Chao</A> reports 
that a circumcised husband is a risk factor for HIV infection amongst 
pregnant
women in Rwanda.<SUP>7</SUP> <A
HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/grosskurth/">Grosskurth et
al</A>. find a higher incidence of HIV infection in circumcised men in
Tanzania.<SUP>8</SUP>

 <P>
The high
incidence of HIV in the United States and its correlation with the high 
rate of circumcision has been noted by <A
HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/general/storms/">Storms</A><SUP>9</SUP>
and <A
HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/nicoll/">Nicoll</A>.
<SUP>10</SUP> Furthermore, 
<A HREF="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7173/1616/b">Tanne</A>
reports a general epidemic of STD, including chlamydia and HIV, in the
United States.<SUP>11</SUP>

<P> Moreover, <A
HREF="http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/STD/fleiss3/">Fleiss and
others</A> report that the increased friction and more vigorous and
prolonged thrusting required to achieve orgasm with a circumcised penis
may be more likely to cause "breaks, tears, microfissures, abrasions, and
lacerations through which HIV in semen can enter the receiving partner's
bloodstream."<SUP>12</SUP>

<P> More research is needed to verify the
protective effect of lysozyme and the foreskin <I>in vivo</I>.
