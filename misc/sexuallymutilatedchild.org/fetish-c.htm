<blockquote>
     I would like to circumcise an adult. I have a fantasy to
circumcise a guy who lost his foreskin in a bet ... or to
forcefully circumcise a man. Any way to get the Tara Klamps in
the States? Any uncut willing to let me circumcise him? I would
one day like to have a jar full of foreskins I circumcised off
guys.

I might just go along to see if I can pick up some videos of boys and 
girls getting snipped. I only live up the road so I might get some good 
wanking material. Circs make me HARD! Snip, snip, The Cutter

<blockquote>
I'd like to change stories/fantasies with people (male and female), who
find a adult male circumcision as an erotic event and who have fantasies
and/or experiences about circumcision. I find an adult male circumcision
including a pregoing examination of the penis and foreskin, discussion on
it, diagnosis and the operation itself sexually very arousing and I think
that the origin and original motives of circumcision include much of sexual
and homoerotic elements. I'd be pleased in changing
stories/fantasies/experiences etc.

circumcised as adults, men interested in being circumcised, men
who enjoy and wish to share their circumcision fantasies, erotic
circumcision scenes, etc." (Foreskin Quarterly #10) The first eleven
issues of FQ (Foreskin Quarterly) each included a column about this
organization. From various issues: "ACORN is looking for a few
good men who need to be SIRcumcised and we are looking for some
good SIRcumcisers." / " Before we cut off your foreskin, I want
you to use it one last time while I watch." / "Take it
off!..Take it all off! ... Acorn wants you skinned." / "I am heavy
into circumcision fantasy, and I have to think of circumcision to
get off." / "Hey, skinhead, if you are man enough, the Sarge and
his knife are gonna take care of you." From a classified ad in
Issue #11: "Acorn Group Forming in Tampa. See the sights of Fla.
and return with the cleancut look. Accommodations, travel plans

the rest European. We find stories of teen boys and men getting
circ'd very hot! We also share our own personal experiences
growing up uncut and admiring the circ'd dicks along with
accounts of our own personal circumcision, medical information,
etc. ... we do have adult only circ fantasy material and
stories of our own personal sexual experiences ... we have
accumulated a variety of circumcision jpegs. Most are clinical
pieces showing the man or boy before, during and after his circ.
They were produced as educational pieces for medical students,
etc. ... I also have some images of ritual or coming of age
circumcisions such as those done in Africa, Egypt and Turkey

pulled brutally ... he ... pressed the knife ... against
the base of the foreskin ... three more clean movements
completed the job; Barker no longer had a foreskin ... the men
around him started, quickly, to jerk off."

Under "Circumcision" (page 6): "Men sometimes incorporate their
fear of circumcision into sex play as a means for arousal. They
fake a circumcision by having their partner blindfold and bind
them, placing a reservoir tipped condom and then slicing off the
tip with a knife ... Women who are only sexually aroused by
circumcised males are referred to as acucullophiles."

GNU is noble, positive. It is to foster pride in being

     <b>Letter to the Editor</b>, Foreskin Quarterly #18, p. 30: "Dear Sir,
Worked with a young Portuguese man at an auto body shop ... He
had a ... very long, thick foreskin tapering to a point. It was
snug, but retractable ... He was fired due to taking dope.
Eight months later, met him, went to a hotel. He stripped down
and ... What a disappointment! He'd been cut! I asked him about
it. He said while in New York he met an older man who offered him
a large amount of money if he'd be circumcised. (How much, he
didn't say.) But he wanted the cash for dope. Two weeks later at
a Central Park West apartment, he stripped and danced as eight
men and a woman watched. He was told to stand and jack off. He
was then bound with his hands behind a large chair, legs spread
and bound to the chair legs. Was given some Novocain, and a large
clamp was applied. He said it was humiliating and degrading,
watching the people get their rocks off as he gritted his teeth
in pain and embarrassment as he was being raped of his
foreskin ... States he still sees their faces, and is depressed 
over prostituting his manhood. No Name Given, NY"

<blockquote>

     "What turned me off the whole circumcision scene was to read
a report recently about a bunch of men nursing erections as they
watched a shrieking baby having his foreskin cut away. When I
contemplate the perfection and symmetry of my little boy's body,
including his penis, I feel a sense of pride at having produced
such a beauty, and I shudder that there are perverts, like I
describe, out there, who would actually take pleasure in marring
his perfection."
