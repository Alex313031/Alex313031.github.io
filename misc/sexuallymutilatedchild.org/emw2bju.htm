I have serious concerns for a 9-year-old child and subject of
the case report "Secondary megaprepuce" [1]. The child was
irrevocably circumcised for reasons the authors clearly admit
were neither medical or surgical. They chose to surgically
deprive the child of a priceless source of ecstatic sexual
pleasure. 
The authors denigrate his sexual birthright into what they 
label a habit, which they proceded to wilfully abolish along 
with a treasured part of his penis. The circumcisers ignored
the documented adverse psychological outcome of circumcision.
Canserver [2] documented that circumcision "is perceived by
the child as an act of aggression and castration. It has
detrimental
effects on the child's functioning and adaptation, particularly
on his ego strength ... What is expressed after the operation 
is primitive, archaic, and unsocialized in character ... the ego 
of the child seeks safety in total withdrawal thus isolates and
insulates itself from disturbing stimuli."

<P>Secondary megaprepuce is not a recognized legitimate diagnosis
listed in the <I>International Classification of Diseases</I> [3].
Recognized legitimate diagnoses include sexual abuse of a child,
mental abuse, emotional abuse, physical abuse and types of 
perpetrators. Recognized legitimate diagnoses listed in the
<I>Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Psychiatry</I> include fetish,
penis envy and voyeurism [4].

<P>According to the authors, adults inspected the child's penis
for 6 to 9 years of his life. In the operating theatre, the
circumcisers masturbated the child's penis to a full erection.
They sustained the child's erection and made close-up, colour
photographs of the child's erect intact penis between the fingers
of his circumciser. Perhaps the circumcisers have a full-length
video showing this technique that they might enjoy sharing. I
doubt the parents or the child gave signed, legal, informed 
consent or refusal to publish the colour photographs of the 
child's erect, intact penis in an international journal. The
circumciser's erection photographs have now gained international
attention. The sight of his penis in the grip of his
circumciser would certainly repulse and enrage the disendowed
child. 

<P>This report demonstrates a case of the wrong procedure on the
wrong organ, of the wrong patient, for the wrong diagnosis.
The child's parents need family and sexual counselling. The
wounded child needs the intervention of child protection
services.
Child circumcisers Gomez, Puyol, and Menendez need a 
circumcision of their professional permits to perpetrate
irreversible
surgical sexual acts upon unwilling children under the
legal age of informed consent or informed refusal. Please publish
a denunciation of this inappropriate childhood non-consensual
surgical sexual act.
