A study of the medical literature on circumcision over 
the last hundred years reveals some odd facts about motives 
and lets us draw some conclusions about why there are so many 
variations in both methods and results.

<P>Originally doctors saw circumcision as both a preventative 
and a cure for masturbation. The beliefs of the Victorian 
era held masturbation in disrepute. It was sinful, therefore 
it must be harmful. We need not dwell on the variety of 
illnesses attributed to masturbation during the late 19th 
century.

<P>Since the instinctive way to masturbate is to fist the 
foreskin back and forth on the penis, one obvious way of 
stamping out masturbation was to remove the foreskin. Once 
this practice was started among people for whom circumcision 
was not a religious injunction, there were soon many other 
"reasons" found for it. A tight foreskin was the "cause" of 
venereal disease, of irritation leading to masturbation, 
bedwetting, nervousness, and a long list of other disorders. 
The practice of circumcision evolved until today we find a 
wide variety of motives among the doctors who perform it, 
which accounts for the differences in surgical techniques 
and amounts of tissue removed.

<P>We can put these motives - and doctors - in categories 
ranging from the altruistic to the sadistic. The pain 
inflicted by the operation varies, as does the nature of the 
ensuing complications. Let’s look at these categories, in the 
awareness that some of them overlap and that the doctors 
often have more than one motive.

<P><b>The Anti-sex Moralist</b>

<P>This type of doctor sees himself as a crusader against 
masturbation and immorality, and his purpose is to suppress 
the sensitivity of the penis. He not only tries to make 
masturbation as difficult as possible for his patient; he 
believes that a radical circumcision will prevent what he 
sees as excessive sexual sensitivity.

<P>He removes as much shaft skin as he can, and all of the 
sensitive inner lining, to attain a very tight cut. He also 
removes the frenulum, the sensitive band on the underside of 
the head, to suppress sensitivity further. The result is a 
glans that is totally bareheaded, exposed to urine from the 
diaper and to friction from clothing.

<P>Often this doctor cuts off so much that when the baby has 
an erection, the edges of the wound pull apart and bleed. 
There is also danger of bleeding from the frenular artery, 
which is cut when the frenulum is removed. In extreme cases, 
with too much shaft skin removed, the ring of the 
circumcision lies well back of the rim; since there is no 
inner lining, the space fills with granulation tissue and 
looks like the scarring that results from a bad burn.

<P>As the boy grows, there isn’t enough skin left on his shaft 
to accommodate the increasing size of his penis, so the 
skin is pulled tightly all the time. Upon erection there 
isn’t enough skin to move freely and the boy must resort to 
a lubricant to aid his masturbation. Some men have reported 
that the size of their erection has been slightly reduced by 
so tight a circumcision. 

<P><b>The Hygienist</b>

<P>This doctor is concerned with retraction of the foreskin 
for cleaning, which is unnecessary for a baby. The foreskin 
and glans are still fused together, which often makes 
retraction impossible. The foreskin protects an infant from 
diaper ammonia and other irritations.

<P>The doctor doesn’t remove the entire foreskin if he feels 
that removing only the forward part will allow sufficient 
room for retraction. He instructs the mother to be sure 
and wash the penis every day, for "hygiene." If he is 
concerned about penile odor, he may excise the entire 
foreskin, paying special attention to the inner lining and 
removal of the Tyson’s glands, which produce one component 
of smegma. He doesn’t necessarily remove the frenulum.

<P>Not removing the entire foreskin can cause one 
complication: adhesion of the cut edges to the glans; these 
may be cut apart later by the pediatrician, but with further 
pain to the baby.

<P><b>The Sculptor</b>

<P>This doctor simply likes the look of the bareheaded penis 
and lovingly tailors the baby’s organ to suit his own idea 
of masculine beauty. He is probably circumcised himself and 
thinks that the bare look is "normal" and that a flaring 
corona is the symbol of such beauty. He may believe that the 
size of the glans and flare of the corona are determined not 
by heredity but by the tightness of the foreskin. Hence he 
removes enough foreskin to expose the glans to the corona, to 
allow unhampered growth. The frenulum being unimportant to 
this purpose, he may leave it on. He also will not cut too 
tightly, just enough to denude the glans, leaving enough 
slack for masturbatory efforts by the boy.

<P>The doctor does as esthetic a job as he can, and the result 
is usually a neat-looking circumcision ring, not the jagged 
line resulting from other types of operation.

<P><b>The Cut-For-Profit Type</b>

<P>This doctor sees circumcision simply as a way to earn an 
extra fee and uses whatever method he has been taught in 
medical school. He wants to get the operation over with as 
soon as possible, to present the mother with her son’s 
bandaged penis as proof that he’s earned his fee. He may cut 
a lot, or only a little. The odds are overwhelming that he 
uses one of the clamp techniques, which are quick and don’t 
result in the radical circumcision of the freehand method. 

<P>This profiteer type runs a mass-production business and 
usually waits until he has several babies for a quick session 
of assembly-line circumcisions. He goes down the line 
hurriedly, with results that vary from one penis to another. 
Some babies escape with relatively minor mutilation; others 
are skinned back severely. This doctor is antagonistic to the 
use of anesthesia because it entails an extra step. He 
doesn’t care about the baby’s screams, knowing that they’re 
an ineffective complaint.

<P><b>The Compassionate Doctor</b>

<P>This doctor removes the foreskin reluctantly and only 
because the parents want it done. He takes care in cutting, 
doesn’t remove too much - perhaps performing a minimal 
circumcision that leaves the head mostly covered - and almost 
always spares the frenulum. He is the type most deeply 
concerned about the baby’s pain and most likely to use local 
anesthesia. Before operating, he’ll allow time for the 
anesthetic to take effect, injecting more [into the penis] as 
necessary to prevent any pain for the baby.

<P><b>The Sadist</b>

<P>This type is rarely documented in medical literature, 
but unofficial reports by medical personnel opposed to 
circumcision reveal that some doctors enjoy performing this 
surgery, laughing and making lewd remarks while doing so.

<P>The sadistic doctor derives a clearly sexual pleasure 
from cutting a baby’s penis, sometimes getting an erection 
during the operation. He enjoys the baby’s pain and takes his 
time doing his job. He never uses any sort of anesthetic; 
that would spoil it for him. He may lie to the mother, 
telling her that the baby is too young to feel any pain. In 
some instances he will fondle the baby’s penis before 
operating, producing an erection. This helps the doctor 
determine how much skin to leave on, but he has an ulterior 
motive as well.

<P>The amount of skin he removes varies according to his 
personal whim. He proceeds slowly and carefully, prolonging 
the operation for as much time as possible. Sometimes the 
baby gets an erection during or after the surgery, as reflex 
reaction to the intense pain, which the doctor enjoys.

<P>We may note that there also exist sadistic nurses who 
enjoy assisting at circumcisions. Their job includes jabbing 
the baby with a syringe - injecting a dose of vitamin K to aid 
blood clotting - and strapping the baby down for the surgery. 
Such nurses enjoy watching the operation and bandaging the 
bloody penis afterward. When changing the bandage, they may 
rip it loose forcefully, causing more bleeding and pain.

<P>Following circumcision, the baby cries whenever he 
urinates, as the hot, acid urine contacts the raw tissue of 
the cut. The sadistic nurse may take her time changing the 
diaper or leave the baby crying in his wet diaper for many 
minutes while she busies herself with something else nearby. 
Some of these nurses are man haters who enjoy seeing a 
helpless male being sexually mutilated and suffering the pain 
of sexual surgery without anesthesia.

<P><b>Instruments</b>

<P>The freehand method, involving scissors or scalpel, 
leads to wide variation in results. If the doctor uses the 
guillotine technique, pulling the foreskin forward and 
cutting off the part extending beyond the glans, the amount 
of skin removed depends on the tension he exerts. If he uses 
the dorsal-slit-and-side-cuts technique, the amount depends 
on his arbitrary choice of a line. The penis may be left 
totally bareheaded or partially covered. Working freehand, 
the doctor may or may not remove the frenulum and will leave 
a varying amount of the mucous inner lining.

<P>The GOMCO clamp is a bell-shaped metal device that fits 
over the head of the penis. Because the infant’s foreskin is 
tight, the doctor usually has to slit it along the top to 
work in the bell. The GOMCO has a ring that clamps down on 
the foreskin after the doctor pulls the latter over the bell. 
The amount of skin removed varies, but never totals the 
amount possible in a freehand operation.

<P>The Plastibell is a plastic bell that fits over the head 
of the penis. The doctor slits the foreskin to widen the 
opening, inserts the bell, and pulls the foreskin up over it. 
There is a groove in the Plastibell for a cord that cuts off 
circulation. Once the doctor has tied the cord in place, he 
removes the skin forward of the cord, leaving the bell on the 
penis. The bell falls off in about a week. Because of the 
approximately one-quarter-inch section of bell behind the 
cord groove, there is always slack when the bell falls off, 
leaving a cuff of skin behind the head.

<P>In cases where the doctor tries for a very tight cut, 
the bell exerts a lot of pressure on the glans and 
surrounding tissue, causing indentations which may be 
permanent or even loss of blood circulation in the glans.

<P>Whatever his method, the doctor has to tear loose the 
foreskin of some babies, those whose inner lining and glans 
have not yet separated. The tearing and the slitting are more 
painful - because they take more time - than the clamping and 
cutting. If the lining has to be torn loose, patches of the 
delicate mucous membrane of the glans often come with it. 
This is the cause of the pockmarks sometimes seen on the 
glans of an older male. Tearing patches from the surface of 
the glans further deadens sensitivity.

<P><b>Summary</b>

<P>We have seen changes in techniques and results over the 
years. Forty or fifty years ago, when masturbation hysteria 
was still prevalent, the favored style of circumcision was 
the streamlines, clean-cut look, with very little shaft skin 
left. The skin was very tight, even in the immature penis, 
and the glans stood out prominently. The frenulum was often 
partly or totally cut away.

<P>With the advent of clamps and the accumulation of 
experience in their use - and the abatement of the 
masturbation phobia - we began to see circumcised penises with 
their glans denuded but a generous cuff of skin left in the 
groove behind the head. The streamlined look was out, and 
there was concern to leave enough skin to allow for erections 
and for growth. Today we see more partial circumcisions - with 
enough hood left to cover the head at least halfway - because 
most of the doctors who push circumcision recognize that 
radical mutilation is undesirable.

<P>The different motives and techniques account for the 
differences we see in circumcised penises. Even among 
circumcised boys in the same family, we can see differences 
if the boys were delivered by different obstetricians, or if 
one was circumcised by the obstetrician and another by the 
family doctor. One will be cut tightly, another loosely, and 
a third may have most of his foreskin left.

<P>Parental preference affect the results. Some mothers 
want their son to match their husband. If the latter was cut 
tightly, the mother may feel cheated if the boy isn’t, and 
may complain or demand a re-circumcision. The same demand may 
be made by a mother who is an avid crotch-watcher and likes 
to view the compound curves of a glans unshrouded by any 
skin. Sometimes parents express their preferences to the 
doctor in advance.

<P>There is no standard method and no agreement on what 
constitutes a "good" circumcision. The result of all this is 
a greater range of differences among remodeled organs than 
among natural, intact ones.
