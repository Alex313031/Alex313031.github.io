<P>
[Masturbation's] Intense Pleasure"</h2>

<h3>And other excerpts from a letter to Rosemary Romberg, 
<BR>author of <I>Circumcision: The Painful Dilemma</I>, 
<BR>from a man in Florida, circumcised at 25</h3></center>

...There are no words to describe how powerful, how
compelling a penis with a foreskin is and how one's
life revolves around it. 
<P>
...Circumcision did not eliminate masturbation, but it
took away its intense pleasure, its extreme sweetness ... 
It became dull, uninteresting, boring.
<P> 
...Foreskins are cut off because they are extremely
pleasurable ... No one who has been clipped in
infancy even realizes it ... Foreskins are cut off to
get the young man's mind off sex ... They are just
too much fun. 
<P> 
...it was wet like the inside of my mouth for 25 years. 
<P> 
...Local anesthesia into the perineum and the freehand
method were used ... they gave me a pill to try and
calm me down ... The whole thing took only a few
minutes once the anesthesia took hold. They told me
there would be no pain. 
<P> 
...there was no pain at all when they made the dorsal
slit and cut the foreskin free at the coronal sulcus,
first around one side of the glans, then the other ... 
They injected a few drops of extra anesthesia directly
into it [the frenulum] ... Then they grasped it with
hemostats in several places, pulled it, poked at it, and
asked me half a dozen times if I could feel anything.
After I said "No" each time, they pulled it well out of
its little V-shaped groove and quickly snipped it. 
<P> 
...with the first snip a tremendous flash of blinding
white pain surged through my entire body! I thought I
had been electrocuted and was dead ... The pain
was not just in my penis, but throughout my entire
body from head to toe. 
<P> 
...The pain was the worst I have ever had in my entire
life, before or since. I cannot any imagine pain possibly
being worse ... the horrible pain. 
<P> 
[It is now known that babies feel as much pain when
they are circumcised as anyone else would.] 
<P> 
...Imagine if it had not been anesthetized at all! 
<P> 
[Most babies circumcised in the U.S. are circumcised
without anesthesia.] 
<P> 
...I wanted everyone who had not been through it to
experience it. 
<P> 
...Circumcision is ... getting it [one's penis] back
broken, bleeding, in great pain, with its most delicate,
sensitive parts ... cut off, permanently weakened. 
<P>
...the glans eventually dried out (a process that took
over a year). 
<P>
...Before circumcision my erections would be extremely
strong ... Now the erection is weaker and the penis
does not get so terribly stiff.

"A remedy [for masturbation] which is almost always 
<BR>successful in small boys is circumcision. The operation 
<BR>should be performed by a surgeon without administering 
<BR>an anesthetic, as the pain attending the operation will 
<BR>have a beneficial effect upon the mind."
