"Parents of intact boys 
<P>should be raising intactivists"
</big></big></b></center>

I think that parents who choose not to circumcise should 
be thinking about full disclosure to their sons about the 
hazard they escaped, on an age-related level, of course. 
Young boys who may question the circumcision of their peers,
and why they look different, should be given explanations 
on a level of understanding according to their age. As they 
grow and mature, a more involved explanation should be 
forthcoming. 
A 13-year-old intact boy should be fully prepared to 
compassionately 
meet the challenge of teasing from circumcised males. A 
16-year-old intact boy should be ready to take a political stance 
against the physical assault of the circumcision of his brothers. 

<P>I feel it is important to relate the full magnitude of the 
trauma that is inflicted daily on baby boys all over this land. 
Being intact carries responsibilities, and a child should  
be raised not just thanking his lucky stars it did not happen
to him, and not giving any other thought to the suffering of 
others. They should be proud in their own bodies and ready to 
defend the insulting slurs that come from circumcising parents 
and doctors about how dirty or ugly or gross intact penises are. 
They are the physical proof that males are capable of thriving 
without circumcision. And at the same time they should be able to 
reach out
to help educate others about the total absurdity of hurting babies. 

<P>Parents need to feel empowered about teaching these principals 
to their boys so that the message does not fade from one 
generation to the next. Complacency among intact children will 
make their own children susceptible to the attacks of
those that would hurt them later on. It is imperative to pass 
on to them the strength to never compromise on this issue ever, 
and teach them to be able to relate this to their own children 
later. Daughters of intactivist also need to know how to be 
able to stand up for males, to resist the pressure from 
without and to defend their brothers and their own
sons when the time comes. 

<P>This is a children's issue and in the 
same way that an adult has no right to do this to a child, 
an adult has no right to withhold vital information that can 
adversely affect the future well-being of generations to come. 
In a way we can consider this a vaccination against being 
infected by the circumcision virus. Inform them and we will be 
able to immunize them and their children from this plague. 

<P>I am 
proud to say that (without setting out to do this 
intentionally at first) we have molded three very staunch 
intactivists, who are very verbal and informed about this
issue. I hope that many of you will get to meet them next 
year in Washington DC at the next march in April.
