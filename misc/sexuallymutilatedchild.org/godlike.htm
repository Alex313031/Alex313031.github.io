can change the world. Indeed it is the only thing that ever has."
Margaret Mead

<P>"Help us tell the American medical community that we are
holding it accountable for this horrendous fraud, that it is the
inviolable birthright of all human beings to keep their genitals
intact, that no one has the right to cut off a baby's foreskin,
and that the genital altering of baby boys in this country must
stop." Marilyn F. Milos, RN, Founder/Director, NOCIRC, <I>NOCIRC

real nice." Midwife, Ocean Springs, Mississippi (about 1990)

mind." John Harvey Kellogg, MD, [the breakfast cereal tycoon]
<I>Plain Facts for Old and Young</I>, 1888

risk ought to be pointed out." <I>Encyclopedia of Bioethics</I>, The
Free Press, 1978

<P>"It is the duty of physicians, who are frequent witnesses of
the enormities committed by quackery, and the injury to health

the injuries sustained by the unwary from the devices and
pretensions of artful empirics and impostors." <I>Code of Ethics</I>, 
American Medical Association, 1847

motives." Sami Aldeeb, Doctor of Law, Staff Legal Advisor, Swiss
Institute of Comparative Law Speaker at the Third International
Symposium on Circumcision

<P>"Though these personal stories are told by women living thousands
of miles apart, they are bound together by a common fate and by a
shared experience imposed on them -- the mutilation of their bodies
and lives ... To take control of our lives and to reach out beyond
the narrow limits imposed on us in societies ruled by men, is a
yearning that women share everywhere in the world. It is a goal we
shall and must achieve for our children, and this is what this book
is all about -- the need for change! The demand for recognition of
our human rights is growing louder everywhere. This fundamental
social revolution is bringing women together and gaining all over
the world ... I hope that what is reported here will convince all
who read it to join together in working for a new, free, open, and
equal way of life." From the Preface of <I>STOP Female Genital

<center><b>FORESKIN RESTORATION</b></center>

<P>"I completed my foreskin restoration last summer, and my wife and

<br>

Association Guidelines Circumcision of Males Infants Guidance for
Doctors</I> (1996)

<P>"We do not support the removal of a normal part of the body,
unless there are definite indications to justify the
complications and risks which may arise. In particular, we are
opposed to male children being subjected to a procedure, which
had they been old enough to consider the advantages and
disadvantages, may well have opted to reject the operation and
retain their prepuce." Australasian Association of Paediatric
Surgeons (1996)

the audience of the <I>Donahue Show</I>, 6/17/87

<P>"[C]ertainty is probably the worst thing for the human soul
imaginable. That was the failure of fascism and communism and
socialism -- people who had an ideology to which they were so

<P>"We are not sexually communicating the right way. People are not

<P>"If the facts presented in this book are not sufficient to
convince some readers that circumcision should be abolished, I
can only say that there exist among us some hopeless people whose
mentality is so paralyzed by the narcotic of religion that
nothing can arouse it from its state of lethargy. But to the
others, to those who have some regard for mankind, who believe
that innocent and helpless children should be defended and
protected from the savage brutality and cruel mutilation of
circumcision, then to them I cry, with all the power and strength
that I possess, with all the vehemence at my command, and from
the deepest recesses of my heart, Stop, in the name of Humanity,
Stop!" Joseph Lewis, <I>In the Name of Humanity</I> (NY: Freethought
Press, 1967)

<P>"Humanity has faced many hurdles during its long, ongoing
evolution from superstition and tyranny to enlightenment and

overcome. The contributors to this volume bring their unique
talents and perspectives on the global problem of sexual
mutilation and suggest strategies for safeguarding the world's
children and the adults they will become from these human rights
violations. Despite the disturbing picture of human frailty and
error they reveal, they share fascinating insights into the human
condition and give hope for future progress." <I>Sexual Mutilations: 
A Human Tragedy</I>, Proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium 
on Sexual Mutilations, August 9-11, 1996, Lausanne, Switzerland

Wayne, MD

<P>"Now, more than ever, it is imperative that the First World
countries acknowledge responsibility for their own form of
genital mutilation, namely, the circumcision of newborn boys. In
the so-called Joan/John case, headlined in the television and
print media in 1997, it was circumcision by electric cautery that
burned off the entire penis down to the pubic bone." John Money, MD, 
Professor of Pediatrics Emeritus at Johns Hopkins
