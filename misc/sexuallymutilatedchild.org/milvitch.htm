<P>"I am a 40 year old mother of five who is finally getting a college education at the Colorado
Rocky Mountain College. As a requirement for an English class, I chose to research the subject of
circumcision with the intent of showing that, while I wasn't against circumcision, anesthesia should be
routinely used. My teacher told us that, in the course of our research, we might find that we needed to
change our thesis statement. Did I ever! The information I uncovered was too late for those I love. I am
determined that, due to my efforts, the information I uncovered will make a difference in someone else's
life. I wish someone had informed me."
