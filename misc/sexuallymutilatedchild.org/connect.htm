<b>Is there a connection between the continually recurring theme
on "men's detective magazine" covers -- the bound, gagged woman
shrinking from a man with a knife -- and the fact that most males
in this country had a similar experience when they were babies, when
someone restrained them, ignored their screams, and cut part of
their penises off?</b>
