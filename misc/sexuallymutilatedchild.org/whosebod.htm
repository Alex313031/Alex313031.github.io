          "A social issue video documentary examining the ethics and the 
human rights issue of
     infant male circumcision. Part One: Wounding Our Children, Wounding 
Ourselves deals with past
     and present medical and social rationale for circumcising children 
of both sexes, foreskin functions,
     adverse outcomes, and legal and constitutional issues. Part Two: 
Healing Ourselves, Healing
     Society deals with men's growing consciousness of this issue, 
changing religious attitudes, foreskin
     restoration, legal and social action, and professional conscientious 
objection." 
</ul>

Whose Body, Whose Rights? is a social issue documentary designed 
for general audiences and for use in discussions of medical ethics, human 
sexuality, and the human rights of children. It explores the growing men's 
awareness of and activism surrounding routine male infant circumcision in 
North America.
<P>
To help viewers better understand why men have become active on this issue, 
basic male anatomy is demystified -- including the structure, function and 
value of the foreskin -- and the scope of the problem and adverse outcomes 
of infant circumcision are revealed.
<P>
Tracing contemporary history from Victorian use of circumcision to control 
the sexuality of children of both sexes, to military circumcision campaigns 
targeting blacks during World Wars, the video examines how circumcision 
became a social custom in English-speaking cultures, especially the 
United States. Current medical ethics are evaluated by men of various ages, 
races, religions and sexual orientations as they share individual and 
collective testimony about the adverse physical, sexual and psychological 
impact on their lives of a surgery they did not choose.
<P>
Women's views are also revealed -- mothers who feel betrayed by the 
medical profession's promotion of painful newborn surgery -- as well as 
survivors of female genital mutilation who expose the cross-cultural 
similarities in beliefs about the disposability of male and female 
children's genitalia.
<P>
This documentary probes the positive steps people are taking to heal 
themselves, to educate others, and to guarantee fundamental human rights 
of body ownership and self-determination for future generations of 
children, through filming of uncircumcision support meetings, interviews 
with doctors who no longer circumcise infants, demonstrations against 
medical associations and suppliers of circumcision equipment, performance 
art pieces, and other art forms.
<P>
Whose Body, Whose Rights? is a unique video ripe for our time, certain 
to provoke both inner reflection and cultural self-examination.

     ". . . very powerful, to the point and
attention-holding." John Money, PhD, Professor of
Medical Psychology and Professor of Pediatrics,
Emeritus, John Hopkins University School of
Medicine

     "Whose Body, Whose Rights? will compel
every health care professional, especially doctors and
nurses, in taking to heart their oath -- Do No Harm."
Norma Wilcox, RN, University of California, San
Francisco Medical School

     "Like many therapists living in a culture that
routinely circumcises, I learned from textbooks that
nearly always showed the penis without a foreskin as
being  normal,  so I presumed that men upset by their
circumcision had a mental disorder. That impression
was dispelled by this video's wealth of factual data
about truly natural male sexual functioning and its
rational look at some of the very adverse outcomes
caused by circumcision." Louanne Cole, PhD, Sex
Therapist and San Francisco Examiner "Sex
Matters" columnist
<P>
     "As a Jewish therapist specializing in men's
issues for the last 30 years, I know that stopping
genital mutilation is the single most important thing
we can do to insure the physical and psychological
health of men." Jed Diamond, LCSW, author, The
Warrior's Journey Home: Healing Men, Healing the
Planet
<P>
     "Whose Body, Whose Rights? reveals the
painful human rights realization that reproductive
integrity and sexual health are repeatedly violated
through destructive sexual surgeries attacking the most
vulnerable members of society." Prof. Anastasios
Zavales, Reporting Officer to UN Working Group
of International Experts on Violations of Genital
Mutilation
<P>
     "This film focuses squarely and necessarily
on the question: Does a child's body belong to his
parents or to him?" Jim Senter, Executive Director,
National Child Rights Alliance
<P>
     "Long-term damage from circumcision, which
this video identifies, can help one to better understand
why growing numbers of men are seeking to regain
their natural genital integrity. Whose Body, Whose
Rights? gives hope to these men that this is not an
isolated or fringe desire." Richard DeSeabra,
Director, National Organization of Restoring Men,
NYC Chapter
<P>
     "The painful cries of little boys being
circumcised remind me of my own painful experience
of female genital mutilation. It is the norm in my
culture to mutilate girls, as it is in the U.S. for boys.
It really terrifies me to know this. Hopefully this film
will educate Americans about the harmful effects of
male genital mutilation." Soraya Mire, Somali-born
Director/Producer of the film about female genital
mutilation, Fire Eyes
