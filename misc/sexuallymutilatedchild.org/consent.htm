<I><big><b>Definition</b></big></I>

<P><B>Circumcision</B>: amputation of all or part of the foreskin (prepuce).

<P><B>Foreskin</B>: sexual tissue richly endowed with highly 
erogenous sex nerves. It provides sexual pleasure, lubrication, 
and a gliding mechanism during intercourse. It makes sex more
gentle, enjoyable, and fulfilling for both partners.

<P>". . . to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the 
organ in question, so that this activity be diminished and the organ be 
in as quiet a state as possible . . . for there is no doubt that 
circumcision weakens the power of sexual excitement, and sometimes 
lessens the natural enjoyment . . . we know how useful the foreskin is 
for that member. In fact this commandment has not been prescribed with a 
view to perfecting what is defective congenitally, but to perfecting 
what is defective morally. The bodily pain caused to that member is the 
real purpose of circumcision. None of the activities necessary for the 
preservation of the individual is harmed thereby, nor is procreation 
rendered impossible, but violent concupiscence and lust that goes beyond 
what is needed are diminished. The fact that circumcision weakens the 
faculty of sexual excitement and sometimes perhaps diminishes the 
pleasure is indubitable. For if at birth this member has been made to 
bleed and has had its covering taken away from it, it must indubitably 
be weakened. The Sages . . . have explicitly stated: It is hard for a 
woman with whom an uncircumcised man has had sexual intercourse to 
separate from him." Moses Maimonides (1135-1204) <I>Guide for the 
Perplexed</I> (NY: Dover, 1956, p. 378)

<P>Treatments for Self-Abuse [Masturbation] and its Effects: 
<br>"A remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is 
circumcision . . . The operation should be performed by a surgeon without 
administering an anesthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation 
will have a salutary effect upon the mind . . . In females, the author has 
found the application of pure carbolic acid to the clitoris an excellent 
means of allaying the abnormal excitement." -- Dr. John Harvey Kellogg

<P>The reasons for medically unnecessary circumcision are: 
to decrease sexual pleasure and fulfillment, to repress
sexuality, religious "purification,"
moral hygiene, power and control, dominance and submission,
"cosmetics," conformity, denial, and foreskin envy.

<P><big><I><B>Curable Foreskin Conditions</B></I></big>

<P>The standard of care for infections is antibiotics, not amputation.

<P>In infancy, the foreskin is fused to the glans like a fingernail to 
its bed and is not retractable. In adults, steroids, cortisone cream, 
stretching, or a radial (dorsal) slit cures an unretractable or tight 
foreskin.


<P><big><B><I>Risks of Circumcision</I></B></big>

<P>The results of circumcision surgery cannot be guaranteed. The only 
guarantee is that you can never replace the foreskin and erogenous
sex nerves. Complications may occur weeks, months, or years later and 
require additional treatment or surgery.

<P><B>Risks of surgery in general</B>: difficulty due 
to anesthesia, drug reactions, infections, brain 
damage, death, heart attack, stroke, local infection, and infection 
spreading into blood poisoning and meningitis.

<B>Risks of local anesthetic injections</B> include high blood pressure, 
breathing suppression, rupture and perforation of the penile nerves and 
blood vessels, and stroke to the penis.


<P><B>Risks of penile surgery</B>: irritation from underwear; infection; 
hemorrhage; failure of the wound to heal; growth of painful neuromas; 
inability to remove the entire foreskin, requiring further procedures to 
remove the remaining foreskin; skin tags and bridges of skin tags 
re-adhering to the remaining raw glans; chronic pain; partial loss of 
erogenous sensation; total loss of erogenous sensation; loss of 
ability to become or remain erect; total loss of erection; painful 
erections; impotence; and total loss of the penis.

<B>Pain in the penis during and after circumcision</B> can result in 
the inability to 
nurse, disrupted sleep, lifelong poor sleep habits, and the inability to 
emotionally bond with mother and other women. The subconscious imprint 
of the painful amputation of sexual tissue can result in the inability 
to trust, the castration complex, the association of sex and violence, 
drug and alcohol abuse, deep-seated rage, free-floating anxiety, panic 
attacks, phobic reactions, sexual addictions (because fulfillment as 
nature intended is no longer possible), a preference for oral sex, learned 
helplessness, hopelessness, resentment toward parents who allowed the 
involuntary circumcision, lawsuits upon reaching legal age, and the 
desire to "restore" the foreskin.

<P><big><B><I>Outcome</I></B></big>

<P>Some men circumcised as adults report a 50 to 90 percent loss of 
erogenous feeling. They liken the circumcised sexual experience to a 
single violin rather than a full orchestra, black and white rather than 
color, two-dimensional rather than 3-D, bland rather than spicy, and 
localized rather than total body experience. Pain after foreskin 
amputation lasts 2-6 weeks. There is pain on urination for two weeks. 
Keritinization (leathery callus formation) and desensitization of the 
mucous membrane of the glans continues throughout life. There is a 100% 
loss of the foreskin’s erogenous nerves, blood vessels, gliding 
mechanism, lubrication, and infection-preventing lysozyme; loss of the 
mobility of the remaining skin of the shaft; loss of the erogenous 
mucous membrane of the glans; and possible negative associations with 
sex and the sex organs. There will be a scar, skin discoloration, and 
possibly keloid formation at the amputation site.

<P>A circumcised male can never know the lubricating, gliding,
and erogenous functions of the foreskin.

<P><big><B><I>Decision</I></B></big>

<P>Ethically, only the patient can make the fully informed final 
decision.

<P>Parents cannot legally consent to medically unnecessary sexual surgery 
for their child.

<P>Like many other laws, the informed consent laws for unnecessary 
amputation of healthy sexual tissue have, until now, been ignored.

<P>The Constitution guarantees the right to the pursuit of happiness. 
Unnecessary amputation of healthy highly erogenous sexual tissue 
violates the constitutional right to the pursuit of happiness.

<P>The 5th Constitutional Amendment guarantees that "The right of 
the people to be secure in their persons . . . shall not be violated."

<P>The 14th Constitutional Amendment extends the equal protection of the 
Federal Female Genital Mutilation Law to males. The "14th Amendment" 
provides for "equal protection regardless of age, gender or race: 
No State shall make or enforce any law which . . . denies 
to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."

<P>The 19th Constitutional Amendment prohibits sex discrimination: 
"The right of citizens 
of the United States shall not be denied or abridged . . . by any State on 
account of sex."

Attorneys for the Rights of the Child</a> 
http://www.noharmm.org/ARC.htm is one test case away from a moratorium 
on the unnecessary, involuntary circumcision of non-consenting children.

<P>Circumcision meets the legal definition of sexual assault and child 
abuse.

<P>LeYoni Junos, Bermuda Section Director of Amnesty International, finds 
circumcision to be both a human rights violation and torture.

<P>Circumcision brands infants’ genitals for life and violates their 
constitutional right to freely choose a religion of their own.

<P>People have a constitutional right to their own thoughts,
beliefs, and forms of worship. A person's right to act out 
their religion, however, ends at the skin of other people.


<P><big><B><I>Documentation and Permission</I></B></big>

<P>I received a copy of this informed consent to take home and keep. I 
have, or my dependent has, a rare non-healing foreskin lesion. A piece 
of the lesion was biopsied and proven under the microscope to be a cancer. 

<P>I authorize removal of only that tissue necessary to eradicate the 
cancer. (Initials:______)

<P>I authorize amputation of the entire foreskin that 
contains the cancer. (Initials:______) 

<P>Reason for the circumcision: 

<P>_________________________________________________________________

<P>I am of legal age. I know the sexual pleasure and the lubricating 
and gliding action of my foreskin. I choose to have it circumcised
