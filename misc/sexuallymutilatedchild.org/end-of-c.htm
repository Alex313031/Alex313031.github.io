<b>The End of Circumcision</b>

<P>With the formation of Doctors Opposing Circumcision
(D.O.C.), we are proposing to end routine neonatal circumcision
in America. D.O.C., a rapidly growing organization of doctors,
intends to bring out the facts about this tragic practice.
<P>
<b>Why Doctors Will Stop Performing Circumcisions</b>
<P>
     All nonreligious circumcisions in the U.S. are performed by
doctors, who will soon be unwilling to perform this painful,
contraindicated procedure. Why?
<P>
      Already, an evergrowing number of physicians are opposed to
routine neonatal circumcision. These doctors recognize that no
one has the right to forcibly remove sexual body parts from
another individual. They recognize that doctors should have no
role in this painful, unnecessary procedure inflicted on the
newborn.
<P>
     Routine circumcisions have been found to violate not only
the Golden Rule, but the first tenet of medical practice, First,
Do No Harm. Amazingly, circumcision violates all seven Principles
of the A.M.A. Code of Ethics.
<P>
     Circumcision is not surgery, by definition. Surgical
procedures have been defined as: repair of wounds, extirpation of
diseased organs or tissue, reconstructive surgery, and
physiologic surgery (i.e. sympathectomy). Routine circumcision
does not fall into any of these categories. Therefore, routine
infant male circumcision is not a valid surgical procedure.
Doctors' licenses do not permit them to cut people unless they
are performing surgery, nor may they harm their patients.
<P>
     America has the highest rate of AIDS in the industrialized
world, and is the only major country which circumcises a majority
of its males. Is there a connection? We do not know. Before a
doctor performs a circumcision, must he not have the answer to
this question: might this baby have an increased risk of AIDS  
as the result of circumcision?
<P>
     American men are now documenting the harm that has been done
to them by doctors who operated on them without their consent.
The bizarre practice of having parents tell a doctor whether and
when to operate occurs nowhere else in medicine. According to
modern medical ethics, parents do not have the right to consent
to a procedure that is not in their son's best interests. The
removal of a healthy, normal part of the male sexual organ is not
in their son's best interests.
<P>
<b>The Courage to Change</b>
<P>
     Why has this behavior continued in the face of overwhelming
evidence that circumcision violates a basic human right   the
right to an intact body? In order for a doctor to stop
circumcising babies, he or she must take a courageous step.
<P>
     The doctor must recognize that what has been done in the
past was not in the best interest of the infant, and he must say,
"I will not circumcise any more babies." Many doctors have
already taken that step, and we honor them. Those who lack the
courage to change continue to circumcise.
<P>
     Many victims of circumcision have moved past denial, and
have refused to permit this procedure to be done to their sons.
Over the past 25 years, some 60 million American parents have had
the courage to refuse circumcision for their sons.
