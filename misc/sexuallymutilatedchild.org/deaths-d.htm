(Toronto), 10/25/69. "How one of two 8-month old male twins was
made into a girl as the result of a medical error is disclosed in
the annual report of the Canadian Medical Protective Association.
The case occurred in Western Canada about two years ago and
although legal action was brought against the doctor, the action
was settled out of court  for a considerable sum ... It
appears that the boy was undergoing circumcision with an
electrical instrument, had his penis destroyed and eventually had
to undergo further surgery to allow him to be raised as a girl ...
the accident occurred after power control dials were
adjusted upwards to achieve the desired cutting effect until ...
a sudden searing sound was heard  and the penis was discovered
to be destroyed ... an incision was made into the infant's
bladder and later both testicles were removed  preliminary to a
series of plastic surgical procedures which will allow the child
to be reared as a female."

<P><b>Circumcision That Didn't Heal Kills Boy</b>
<br>CLEVELAND, October 20, 1998 -- A 3-week-old boy
died while doctors were trying to fix a problem with his
circumcision.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A pediatrician noticed the circumcision performed on Dustin Evans
two weeks ago wasn't healing properly and the urethra was
blocked. A routine surgical procedure was needed to correct the
problem and clear the hole. While being administered anesthesia
on Friday, the boy's heart stopped, said his father, Dustin Evans
Sr., 27.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Doctors at Rainbow Babies Childrens Hospital attempted to save
the baby by massaging his heart and inserting breathing tubes.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He was kept on a life-support ventilator system during the day
until it was determined that his heart was healthy, but he had
suffered massive brain damage.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dustin was disconnected from life support about 7:30 p.m. Friday.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"You think, 'What could go wrong with a circumcision?' "Evans
said. "The next thing I know he's dead."
