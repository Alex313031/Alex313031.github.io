Dear Carla,
<P>
My heart goes out to you for all the suffering you
have felt at the hands of your surgeons. The long
surgical slices that "trimmed" your "redundant" inner
labia also cut and irreversibly destroyed your sensory
sex nerves to your clitoris, your remaining labia, and
your perineum, forever robbing you of your birthright
to total orgasmic fulfillment. Nothing can ever bring
those nerves back.
<P>
It appears that your surgeons also cut your motor
movement nerves to your vaginal and perineal muscles.
You are paralyzed, with no ability to contract and
relax those muscles. It appears they cut out the lower
third of your vaginal tube, making it too short; cut
off your ring opening (introitus); cut off your inner
labia; and cut out a lengthwise strip of your vaginal
tube, making it too narrow for you to comfortably, much
less enjoyably have intercourse. Your surgeons
"reconstructed" mucous membranes that make no mucus,
leaving you dry, ripping apart, and bleeding. The
"reconstructed" parts don't work, can feel no pleasure,
yet leave you in constant pain.
<P>
You never gave signed legal consent to a Left and
Right (Bilateral) Dorsal Clitoral Neurotomy (nerve
cutting), Left and Right (Bilateral) Labial Neurotomy,
Left and Right (Bilateral) Perineal Neurotomy, Left and
Right (Bilateral) Vulvectomy, or Vertical Subtotal
Vaginectomy. Cutting your sexual orgasmic sensory
nerves and removing your genital tissue without valid
medical indication and your signed legal consent is
battery -- a crime against you, all who know and love
you, and all womankind. It is ruthless rape with a
knife.
<P>
You feel "dead" because your surgeons permanently
destroyed your ability to experience sexual sensation.
When you complained about being dead, your surgeons
concealed the fact that they knowingly cut your sex
nerves and altered your genitals. No one can see your
severed sex nerves. The doctors you consulted were able
to ignore your loss of sexual sensation because it is
invisible. They told you that your remaining surgically
altered tissue "looks good." This is called conspiracy,
concealment, and fraud. It is illegal according to
hospital bylaws, state laws, and federal laws. It is
doubly illegal. It is illegal to do and illegal to
cover up.
<P>
Your surgeons and others you consulted added insult
to your injury by labeling you a psycho sex case.
You're a live, walking, talking woman claiming to be
dead.
<P>
Your damage is emotional as well as physical and
psychological. You feel dead in spirit as well as body.
Emotional deadness is called depression in medical
language. Your deadness affects your whole life, day
and night, everything you do or are too drained to do.
It affects your relationships with everyone. You have
all the symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome:
depression, irritability, anger, rage, flashbacks,
nightmares, and thoughts of murder and suicide.
<P>
Yes, sensory deprivation causes permanent brain
damage or dysfunction. Brain atrophy or dysfunction due
to sensory deprivation is well documented by Nobel
Prize winners D. H. Hubel and T. N. Wiesel. The brain
receptors that represent your sex nerves atrophy or
become dysfunctional from disuse. Sexual thoughts,
images, and especially sensations activate the limbic
system, the reticular activating system, and other
structures of the brain. The RAS enlivens and
energizes. It enables one to concentrate. You are
preoccupied, stuck in time, and have flashbacks. You
have phenomenal regret. You can't concentrate or make
your dreams come true. Your life is forever altered.
<P>
Your Medical Record History documents no complaint
or reason that would warrant your original surgery.
Your surgeon's suggestion that he repair a hernia that
never bothered you is suspicious. The surgery your
surgeon talked you into is not the surgery you woke up
to find he had performed. You woke up to find yourself
sewn so tight that you could not have intercourse or
discharge your menstrual flow. It took you a year to
find someone to create an artificial opening. Your
subsequent "repair of the repair," and then your
"repair of the repair of the repair," left you with a
deformed, sexually dead but painful penile receptacle. 
<P>
The word "repair" is a euphemism. You cannot be
repaired. There is no legitimate procedure called a
"second stage reverse perineorrhaphy." Nor is there a
legitimate procedure called a "first stage reverse
perineorrhaphy." There are no such procedures listed in
the Current Procedural Terminology handbook. Amputation
and mutilation cannot be reversed. Severed sex nerves
cannot grow back. Severed <I>pain</I> nerves, however, do
grow back, even more sensitive and sometimes with
agonizing neuromas. Severed pain nerves can give you
the well-known phenomenon of phantom pain. 
<P>
Your Medical Record History fails to explain the
procedures, reasons, expectations, success rates,
alternatives, and specific risks or benefits of your
surgeries. This constitutes lack of informed consent,
which is medical malpractice. Some incidental
procedures require no legal signed consent. An
"incidental" procedure as serious as cutting your sex
nerves, removing parts of your sex organs, and
misaligning what's left, must be told to you and your
husband in no uncertain terms. No woman, except to save
her life from cancer, would ever consent to such
mutilation. It is self-evident that you never gave
informed consent. 
<P>
I sense a profound disrespect for women in your
surgeon's Physical Examination Report. The fabricated
report is degrading, demeaning, and humiliating. Your
surgeon's description of your physical characteristics
is a statement about your surgeon's integrity, not a
statement about you. The mention of "evidence" of a
previous, unrelated operation is irrelevant to the
surgery your surgeon was about to perform. The word
"evidence" more aptly applies to your surgeon's
upcoming crime. The graphic false description of the
physical signs of your previous pregnancies is
irrelevant and in poor taste. It is an attempt to blame
your children rather than your surgeons for your
trouble and to shame you into silence. Silence, shame,
and blame are the sex abuser's tools. Add to these a
license, the sanctity of an operating room, your trust,
their betrayal, and their trivialization of your true
cost in body, mind, and soul. Your surgeons legitimize
and institutionalize female genital mutilation.
<P>
Your surgeon's sketchy Operative Report is
unacceptable. It fails to document enough to tell what
he did, much less whether he did it correctly. Your
surgeon states that he removed "mucosa." Your "meat"
loss comes from removing more than just mucosa. 
<P>
Finally, I find no Pathology Report. Your medical
record fails to document the entire specimen's size,
weight, shape, color, appearance, and consistency. Your
medical record also fails to document a microscopic
examination of your tissue specimen. A microscopic
examination might have documented that your dorsal
clitoral and other sex nerves had been cut or removed.
State laws and hospital bylaws mandate pathology review
of all tissue removed from your body at surgery. That
the mandatory tissue review is missing from your
medical record is called negligence. If it is against
the law in your state, the missing tissue and the
missing tissue report are criminal offenses. Their
conspicuous absence denotes a coverup.
<P>
It is illegal to cut out your genital tissue and
toss it in the trash. You can forgive a mistake of the
mind. You can forgive a mistake of the hand. But you
cannot forgive a "mistake" of the heart. This is not a
poor result. This is not botched surgery. This is 
mal-intent. This is premeditated savage surgery and
criminal rape with a knife. 
<P>
Rape with a phallus is far kinder. You are awake
and can fight. You know what is happening. You still
have your sex organs. You owe no money. You owe no
thanks. And it's called what it is: a crime.
<P>
The investigators knew the law. The attorneys
knew or should have known the law. They may be
responsible to you for legal malpractice, just as your
doctors are responsible to you for medical malpractice
and criminal assault. Because of the fraud, battery,
concealment, and conspiracy, your statute of
limitations begins the day of discovery. Your day of
discovery is the date of this letter. Fraud commands
triple damages. If a gynecologist refuses to certify
your case as malpractice and bills you for that
"opinion," file a fraud, conspiracy, and obstruction of
justice suit against that gynecologist. Then file a
battery suit instead of a malpractice suit against all
of your surgeons. 
<P>
They mutilated your body. They messed up your mind.
They crushed your spirit. They broke your heart. They
carved you into a sexual zombie and created a monster
within you. Then they deny -- and relish -- your
suffering.
<P>
<I>This letter of truth now deals a deathblow to
denial.</I>
<P>
For the sake of women everywhere, cry out and let
your voice be heard. Let your rage burst into action.
Expose your perpetrators as the compulsive sexual
preditors they are. Pursue any and every medical,
legal, social, emotional, spiritual, financial,
educational, political, and legislative remedy. The
world is a better place for all your efforts and I
applaud you. If we had a thousand more like you, it
would be heaven on earth and safe for all the world.
<P>
Respectfully,
<P>
Eileen Marie Wayne, M.D.
