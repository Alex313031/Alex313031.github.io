A Jewish mother's awakening</big></big></b></center>

<br>

Hello Bernie,

<P>I read your posts and they really did hit home. I am Jewish and a
mother and have to admit I was extremely ignorant and
unenlightened on the issue. Our street was filled with non-Jews
who circumcised their children and the media is filled with
images of the circ'd penis as normal and the inact penis as
bizarre, ugly and dirty. Every brochure on birth control or
anatomy features the circ'd penis. It's like the foreskin was
less than even a useless flap of skin. It was a breeding ground
for infection. I remember my father once told me a story about
the foreskin inspections in the army in his day. They painted
them with some chemical and if they proved to be dirty they
risked circumcision. So in my mind circumcision not only was
mandatory for the covenant but it was actually preferable. Hell,
it was great to be circumcised. The foreskin was just awful,
who'd ever want to keep it. It had no value.

<P>Don't laugh but the only uncirc'd penises I ever saw were in some
ancient issue of Playgirl as a teen which had a feature on "the
men of Europe". Weird looking I thought. Where's the glans? They
always showed them flacid so I had not one clue that this skin
actually retracts! I thought those poor sods, they can't even
enjoy sex with that raincoat covering their whole organ. I felt
sorry for them. I had no clue that the foreskin was continuous
with the shaft skin. I thought the amount removed was fixed like
it was an exact science. Of course I didn't know that in a baby
the foreskin is fused to the glans.

<P>In America we live in a very sexually repressed society. No one
is showing us the pictures of the foreskinned penis and how it
becomes erect and all of that stuff that I now am seeing on the
net. I wasn't into porn and frankly I've never took such a
detailed look at even circ'd penises. I never even could figure
out where that circ scar that I now understand is. And I had
little reason to hunt down this info because all the famous and
sexy movie stars in America are circ'd. Every man I'd ever been
with had been circ'd and unlike women who've undergone female
mutilation there is one difference. The difference is that a
female can reproduce with or without an orgasm. Not true for a
male. Circ didn't seem to cause impotence and so there wasn't any
reason in my mind to delve into the issue.

<P>Oh yes there were some anti-circ rumblings. I once saw a crackpot
man on TV practically crying saying that he remembered screaming
during his circumcision. What a nutcase I thought! I never
remembered anything prior to kindergarten and I never met a man
who remembered his circ. As long as the anti-circ movement was
populated with people speaking about remembering screams and talk
of being rendered sexual cripples they were totally irrelevant as
far as I was concerned. They were like the pro-life folks with
their gory photos. Emotional hooey with junk science about
encoding the brain with violence and what have you. As if Hitler
and Stalin were circ'd. Give me a break! I have to say as long
as they continue in that fashion of calling parents who are
mostly ignorant, child abusers then they will get nowhere.
Offensive people like X.X. who posts in the newsgroups are the
worst thing for the anti-circ movement. If I ever encountered
this holier than thou smug creep calling me a child abuser and
lecturing to me what Judaism should and should not be you can be
damned sure I would never have listened to a word they said. In
fact it's a miracle I was able to wade through the anti-circ crap
to find some kernels of truth.

<P>To continue, yes, I had been to a Brit but I never stared at the
penis before or after and I couldn't figure out what the hell was
happening with those wacky clamps flying everywhere.  Sure the
baby did cry but babies are always screeching. I believed the lie
that it doesn't hurt or at least it doesn't hurt that much. Or
that they cry because they are being restrained. Sure I'd met
a couple of non-Jewish mothers who didn't do it. In most cases
the dads were from Europe or Hispanic and I thought poor little
idiots they just think it's more important to look like Dad than
take part in the wonderful health benefits that circ offers.

<P>Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment but I been reading up on the
issue and I have been reading the rants in the alt.circ group and
I feel very overwhelmed and I am consumed with guilt and horror
that I carried out this barbaric ritual on my son out of complete
and total ignorance. I'm not trying to let myself off the hook
easy but I too feel violated by this ritual cutting. I feel I
have been betrayed by being lulled into a false sense of
complacency by the tacit approval of Routine Infant Circumcision
by the medical community, the media, American culture and of
course Judaism.  We are influenced by our culture and Doctors are
still considered like demi-Gods. They don't seem to be actively
opposing circ or at least putting out the information that the
foreskin has value and so of course we think nothing of cutting
it off. Hell, if cutting off a useless appendage can save you a
UTI or an infection then heck why not? It was great health
insurance and you'd satisfy the ol' covenant.

<P>Every mother I've ever talked to in the aftermath of circumcision
especially non-Jews said it was no big deal. The baby just slept
through. Jewish mothers were much the same only they at least
witnessed the gory details upon closer inspection. So they were a
little less non-chalant but not by much. I had a very good
relationship with my mother and she carried out the covenant on
my brother who also never had a problem with it. She was a great
mom so tell me how could I ever realize it was not what it seemed
to be? How dare anyone call my mother a child abuser!  How dare
anyone accuse Judasim of being barbaric when in America we've
decided circumcision is a great health measure on top of that.

<P>So proudly I embarked upon the covenant with my son now nearly
three years old. My husband being Jewish never gave it any pause
either. I didn't even run crying out of the room during the
procedure. Now why in the world did I all of a sudden wake up to
this issue you might ask when most people Jew and non-Jew alike
don't give a moment's pause?

<P>First off the Brit was more than I bargained for. My baby was
supposed to stop crying after it was over and sleep it off until
morning and be totally fine. That's what all the other mom's told
me would happen. That's what I expected to happen. Well that did
not happen. My child continued to cry and awakened every hour
until I couldn't stand it. I called the mohel exasperated. By the
way I the mohel I chose was highly recommend and he came from 5
generations of mohelim. So I put some effort into choosing him. I
told him he keeps crying what should I do?

<P>He said take of the dressing that will make him feel better. So I
got the go ahead to remove it before 24 hours. I had to remove it
myself and it seemed so tight and the proof was that my baby was
relieved when it was off. I called the mohel back to rant about
this and he said "he was urinating right?" I said yes, the whole
time. So it wasn't tight, some babies are just more fussy and
bla bla bla. Then I hated the mohel and I could have killed him.
Maybe I hated the whole idea that my baby had to endure this and
so I was taking it out on the mohel. That incompetent jerk I
thought! He made my baby suffer!

<P>Then I read through the healing description and the follow-up
care. I was confused. It said the head of the penis will be red
and raw and often it will turn yellow and crust over with a film
during healing which should resolve by two weeks. I should
continue changing the gauze with bactricin at every diaper change
until healed. Then as someone who has studied biology I began to
question. If he cut of the skin where I saw that circ scar then
why is the head so frigging irritated? It didn't sit well with
me. But I let it pass. Unlike other babys whose glans healed
quicker it took my baby the full two weeks.

<P>Then at about 6 months or so it looked like his penis was
disappearing. I showed my husband who thought it looked fine. I
took him to the pediatrician and he said no biggie but he's got a
foreskin adhesion. He applied some pressure to the base of the
penis and the penis popped out and the edge of the glans was now
revealed in it was all red and irritated and there where pockets
of white stuff in there. I didn't understand, I thought a circ'd
penis was supposed to be low maintenance. I'd been following all
the care instructions and he got a bath every night. How can he
have a foreskin adhesion if he doesn't have a foreskin, I
thought? I've since met another mom whose child also had this
condition whereby the foreskin wants to reattach to the glans
much like a pierced ear would close up without an earring. It's
actually not a rare complication as my pediatrician didn't make a
big deal out it. Like oh well, no biggie.

<P>By this point I was convinced that bastard mohel did something
wrong. I did a little research on circ and I didn't like what I
found out about the procedure or the foreskin. I was mortified
that I was so ignorant of the mechanics of the foreskin and how
it was removed. I didn't know anything at all about the foreskin
and now I was discovering the truth of it. It wasn't useless at
all. The sexual issue might be subjective but it is truly hard to
believe that that much tissue located in the genital region
doesn't offer at least some contribution to sexual sensation? How
could I have believed otherwise? Because I've always been told
about the health benefits of circ, no one ever said that the
foreskin itself had any value. The risks where that the procedure
could be botched but not that loss of a foreskin was a bad thing.
That's what I'd always heard. Of course I'd always been told that
our mohels were so skilled that it was only the doctors who were
messing up circumcisions. Of course we might be a bit better at
performing circumcisions but our mohels have done plenty of
damage too.

<P>After my son was about 2 years old I was still at it. Still
looking for problems. Was it done right? I'd ask my pediatrician
constantly. It looks fine he would say. I noticed a
little variation in the skin texture and color from day one. I
asked him about it. It's nothing he'd say. I said it's not from
the diaper it's always there I said! He said well I never took
out a microscope but I think it's minor. Is it from the circ I
insisted?! He didn't think so but he wasn't positive. But in any
case I should view it as a little freckle or zit it won't have
any impact on his sex life etc.

<P>I needed to know! I wanted a referral to a urologist. He gave me
one. In the meantime I called up the mohel and he remembered I
was the one who was irate about the bandage. I said point blank,
you better come clean did you clamp my son's penis with that
clamp! He denied it and asked my why after 2 years I now suspect
this. I described the marking and he said that it didn't happen
because if it did I would have seen lots of blood there not just
a marking and he wouldn't have used a standard bandage which was
open at the tip like the one he had. He made sense and I felt
better but I still wanted that urology appointment.

<P>I met the urologist and talked at length in his office before the
exam. I described what I considered the brutal surgery, slow
recovery, tight bandage, the adhesions and the odd color at the
tip of his penis. He looked saddened like he was prepared to see
a botch job. Then he took a look at my son and smiled. He said
it's a normal skin variation akin to a birthmark, not
pathological and not caused by the circ. In fact he looked the
circ over and said it was not only good but excellent and that I
should even call up the mohel and compliment him. He'd be proud
if his own son had a circ like that. The Dr. was not Jewish
either. So I felt better, but I thought to myself if my baby can
have all these minor complications from an excellent circ then
this was really more brutal than I had anticipated. What of the
babies who are truly maimed by circs. And it's not true that only
Drs. do the botch jobs. Mohels screw up too. How would I feel
about Judaism if I was one of the unlucky ones that lost my penis
due to some stupid medically unnecessary intervention. That's
what turned the corner for me. Even if death and maiming are rare
they are still a price too high to pay certainly for a non-Jew
and yes, of course even for a Jew.

<P>I have come full circle. I'm angry and upset too. Of course it's
not my penis but he is my son and I feel that rage too. I'm not
planning any more children but if an accident should happen, how
could I ever do another Brit? I couldn't. Then my two sons will
be different. The contrast might be unbearable. It's a totally
slap in the face to Judasim. If I had a second son he would be
the only one in the preschool bathroom with a foreskin!!

<P>There are lots of questions. Should I bury the issue? Do I really
need my son to feel like a sexual cripple when most men don't
give it much thought? Ignorance is bliss. I was ignorant. Should
I keep him in the dark? Or should I tell both my kids that I
hated circumcision and I felt violated and I hope they won't pass
on this archaic tradition.

<P>I hope you don't mind that I took the liberty of writing you this
long letter, but it sounded like you were angry at your parents
so maybe I'm looking for forgiveness or at least understanding.
But I just wanted to let you know that finally I can see the
light on this issue. It's not an easy journey for a parent
especially a Jew. I'm going to be celebrating Passover with my
family and I don't feel very positive about it. Just wanted to
let you know that there are some Jewish parents who get the 
message albeit too late.
