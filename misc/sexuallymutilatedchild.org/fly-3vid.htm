<b>Deeper Into Foreskins (Nine Intact Men Show You Theirs)</b> 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Live footage of the normal, natural (not restored) foreskins
of nine intact adult males, one at a time. Brightly lit, sharply
focused, ultra-clear close-ups (foreskin often filling entire
screen), shot from every angle. Shows: numerous foreskin
variations (long, loose, snug, tight, thick, thin, etc.); outside
fold; frenar band; mucocutaneous junction ("lip"); mucosal inside
fold; frenulum relaxed; frenulum taut (pulling glans back toward
shaft); phimosis (non-retractable foreskin); various stages of
erection and foreskin retraction; expansion and contraction of
preputial orifice as foreskin folds and unfolds (rolls and
unrolls) back and forth over glans; movement, mechanics and
synchronization of entire penile skin system in masturbation;
masturbation to ejaculation (final sequence). Foreskins only; no
bodies or faces. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VHS. Color. Video only; no sound. 
27 minutes. $30. 

<blockquote>
"Rather than viewing slides of pathological foreskins to 
rationalize our destructive custom of circumcision, sexologists, 
physicians and medical students should view this provocatively intimate 
video to better understand the unique mechanical structure and exquisite 
sensual functions of the healthy male prepuce -- robbed from males born 
in the U.S. today at the rate of one every 2 seconds."

<B>John Iozza Shows You His Foreskin</B> 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
John Iozza, the 37-year-old balloon artist from Boston who
has attended all four symposiums on circumcision, was also at the
Strategies for Intactivists Conference in Evanston, Illinois,
April 1996, where this documentary was made. Showing a rare gift
for congenial, candid improvisation, he stands nude before the
camera and talks about: his experience growing up intact; how, as
a child, he glued and taped his foreskin back to look circumcised
like the other boys; the doctors who tried to persuade his mother
to have him circumcised; the sensitivity of his foreskin and
frenulum; and eventually becoming aware that he was the lucky one
after all. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He inserts a pair of closed scissors between his foreskin
and glans to show how a baby's foreskin is first torn from the
glans before it's cut off. Then he shows how the foreskin is cut
lengthwise. He inserts a bottle cap under his foreskin and over
his glans to show how the Gomco clamp is used. He shows the
PlastiBell technique by tying his foreskin over the bottle cap
with dental floss. He draws lines on his foreskin with a felt-tip
pen to show how much tissue circumcision would have removed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He invites calls from anyone who would like to talk with him
or see his intact penis. He explains why everyone -- little girls
<I>and</I> little boys -- should be allowed to keep their genitals
whole, natural, normal and intact.

<B>Brian Levitt Shows You His Foreskin Restoration In Progress,
Demonstrates the T-Tape Method, and Shares His Thoughts and Feelings
About Bris</B> 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>July 1995 (Greenbrae, California)</i>: Brian Levitt, children's
rights advocate and anti-circumcision activist from San
Francisco, at the NOHARMM March and Rally at Marin General
Hospital: carrying large "Jews for the Rights of the Child"
poster; foreskin restoration strap from his shorts down his leg
to his foot; Bella, his sweet-natured Doberman with ears and tail
intact, at his side.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>September 1995 (Berkeley, California)</I>: Brian's Levitt's
penis a couple months after he started non-surgical restoration:
circumcision scar; remaining frenulum; elevation under skin
behind his glans later diagnosed as Sclerosing Lymphangitis,
possibly caused by his circumcision; contrast between shaft skin
and foreskin's mucosal inside fold externalized by circumcision.  
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>February 1997 (Biloxi, Mississippi)</I>: After about a year and
a half of restoring: pulling new skin forward over his glans;
showing and explaining in close-up detail each step of making and
applying the T-tape; applying the T-tape to his erect shaved
penis; inserting cotton balls and stainless steel ball bearing
into the tape tube for more weight and stretch; attaching
suspenders to tape and foot; thoughts, feelings, miscellaneous
comments; reading his statement, "When I realized that Judaism
cut me off from part of myself, I cut myself off from Judaism."

<B>Unsolicited comments:</B>

<P>     "[Deeper Into Foreskins] beautifully and very naturally
captures the simple functions and attributes of the foreskin and
natural penis."

<P>     "I was absolutely astounded by the beauty of Deeper Into
Foreskins. Really, it's the most beautiful presentation of
foreskin on video I've ever seen! Not only is it aesthetically
beautiful, it's technically beautiful also."

<P>     "I never really allowed myself to appreciate the amazing
qualities of the foreskin until I watched your video. Thanks for
opening my eyes and mind wider than ever before. I have a new
sense of mission today that I didn't have before." 

<P>     "It [Deeper Into Foreskins] made me feel connected and that
I don't need a circumcision to fit into America's mainstream."

<P>     "John Iozza's demonstration on his own penis of what is lost
by circumcision is the most persuasive argument against
circumcision I've ever encountered."

<P>     "The John Iozza tape should be given maximum distribution.
He is the right age to be convincing. He presents the case very
well. His information is perfect."

<P>"The John Iozza tape is <i>incredible</i>!"

<P>     "I received the John Iozza and Deeper Into Foreskins tape
and am another <I>satisfied</I> customer. You sure delivered just what
you advertised."

<P>     "The Brian Levitt video moved me to tears ... You can see
in Brian's face the uncensored truth of what's been done to
millions of men. Thank you for documenting a shameful part of our
history and for the hope you are giving to men contemplating
foreskin restoration." Mary Conant, RN, Nurses for the Rights of
the Child

<P>     "I found the Brian Levitt video incredibly moving ... I
hope that Jewish parents all over the world will get a chance to
see it." Betty Katz Sperlich, RN, Nurses for the Rights of the Child

<P>     "I was rivited to the screen -- almost hyp-motized as
Letterman might say."

<P>     "I loved your video." [From an M.D.]

<P>     "Your videos are wonderful."

<br><br><br>

Please note:
<br>I have no videos of children or for children and
don't know or want to know anyone who does. If you are looking
for videos showing the genitals of children, try Sing Sing or San
Quentin.
