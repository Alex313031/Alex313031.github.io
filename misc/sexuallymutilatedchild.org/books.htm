[To the best of my knowledge, all of the books below, except 
where noted otherwise, were in print and available as of May 2000. 
Many are available from 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I see pro-circumcision literature -- especially contemporary
pro-circumcision literature -- as documentation of a foreskin 
extermination conspiracy -- although it is still taboo, even 
among those who share this view, to openly refer to it as such.
I think this malicious, destructive, anti-human literature and 
those who propagate it should be exposed, not suppressed. 
The books below that advocate what amounts to foreskin amputation 
by force (the circumcision of babies) are marked with an asterisk.

Searching Amazon "Books" for "circumcision" 6/1/00 yielded 102 hits,
including many about female genital mutilation. --JAE]
