I'm writing this to help anyone thinking about circumcision for
himself or anyone else make the right decision. 

<P>I was born in North Carolina in 1932, an only child. I knew
nothing about circumcision until I began
school. I noticed two boys in the rest room who always had their
glans exposed, but I didn't know why.
This seemed strange to me, but I didn't ask anyone about it. My
father and all of my playmates were
intact. My glans had always been extremely sensitive, and the
idea of having it constantly exposed seemed
unnatural and uncomfortable to me.

<P>When I was about nine, one of my younger cousins came for a
visit. He had just been circumcised by my
uncle, a surgeon. His penis was raw and inflamed and needed
ointment to ease his discomfort. I didn't
know why he was circumcised, but I assumed it must have been for
a good reason. 

<P>As far back as I can remember, I had frequent erections and
discovered early that slipping my foreskin
back and forth over my glans felt wonderful. My glans was so
sensitive that I couldn't bear to touch it
directly. I could stimulate it comfortably and pleasurably only
indirectly through my foreskin. Each stroke
was like a mini-orgasm. 

<P>I had my first ejaculation when I was eleven. For the next 19
years, I enjoyed every aspect of my sexuality
but was unaware of how fortunate I was to have a strong sex drive
and a fully functioning intact penis to
enjoy it with. 

<P>With experience, I gained control over my super-sensitivity,
but with no loss of pleasure. I learned to pace
myself and used various techniques to extend or compress the time
I needed to reach orgasm, as the
occasion demanded. I discovered many different ways to slip my
foreskin back and forth over my glans to
experience a whole universe of indescribably pleasurable
sensations. When I slipped my foreskin all the
way back, the sensitive mucosal inside lining covered almost my
entire shaft. I could trigger an orgasm that
felt like no other just by retracting my foreskin and holding it
all the way back. The exquisite tension
pulled down the entire head and stimulated all the pleasure
receptors in my frenulum, mucosa, head and
shaft. I could also trigger orgasm just by gently squeezing my
frenulum. I've known several intact men but
no circumcised men who could reach orgasm these ways. 

<P>I enjoyed my full natural intact sexuality until I was 30.
Then, during a routine physical exam, my doctor
said my long foreskin would probably cause me future problems and
recommended circumcision. Not
knowing any better, I consented. He gave me no information and
told me nothing about how much
foreskin, frenulum and mucosa he would remove. He circumcised me
in a hospital under general
anesthesia. His fee was $50.

<P>Getting circumcised turned out to be one of the worst mistakes
of my life. I feel damaged on almost every
level. My ability to experience sexual pleasure has been reduced
by at least 70% both in intensity and
range of sensations. I cannot overstate the regret, frustration,
anguish and, yes, suffering my loss of sexual
sensation, satisfaction and gratification has caused me. I feel
sad and angry every time I see the scar. 

<P>The doctor cut me so tight that the skin he left feels as if
it's going to tear when I have an erection. He cut
away all of my frenulum and left only a half inch of my
foreskin's inner lining. I had 22 stitches. I had to
wear a condom for about a month because the friction of clothing
against my now denuded glans kept me
almost constantly erect. The process of desensitization began
immediately, however, and continues to this
day, 36 years later. By the time I was 50, I had difficulty
reaching orgasm and needed extreme physical
stimulation and intense concentration and fantasizing to reach
what an intact man the same age reaches
gently, easily and enjoyably. What had been an intensely erotic
response from the first retraction of my
foreskin over my glans is now, by prolonged concerted effort, a
struggle to feel enough sensation to reach
orgasm at all. Before I was circumcised, I enjoyed every step,
facet and plateau of every sexual experience.
Experiencing this pleasure required no conscious effort, only
surrender to all-encompassing pleasure. The
only intensely pleasurable part of sex for me now is the orgasm.

<P>The penis has three erogenous zones: the glans, the foreskin
and the frenulum. The circumcised male has
two of these structures, the foreskin and frenulum, removed or
rendered non-functional and the remaining
structure, the glans, desensitized, its normal red, glistening,
sensitive skin replaced with thick dry skin 4-16
cells thick. The skin on the glans of an intact male is only 2-3
cells thick.

<P>For an adult male to be misled into circumcision is
regrettable, but to inflict this permanent, irreversible,
irreparable damage on an infant or child, who must live with the
physical and psychological scars his entire
life, is tragic -- and a crime.

<P>The testimony of men who have experienced life with a foreskin
and then lost it is perhaps the most
damning of all arguments against circumcision. 

<P>If telling my experience saves even one baby from this
mutilation, I will feel well rewarded. 

<P>I'd be glad to hear from anyone who cares to call or write.

they just anecdotal?]
