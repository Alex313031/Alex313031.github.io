Babies are a miracle. They come complete and perfect with all their
functional parts ready to develop into a total human being. It is our
job as parents, teachers, and others to guide them in their growth and
development to become the best they can be -- to become intelligent,
compassionate, healthy individuals in mind, body, and spirit.

<P>A baby is born into an imperfect world, yet he or she is pure and full
of trust. A baby's wants and needs are simple. A baby needs nourishment --
not only physical, but emotional nourishment. S/he wants to be held and
hugged and loved and kissed and touched, to hear music -- soothing and
gentle sounds -- like those produced by a harp, cello, or human voice.

<P>It seems absurd that today we choose to mutilate a significant
percentage
of our newborn infants. As a young medical student in the 1960s, I
learned
the technique of performing the surgical procedure of male circumcision.
It was not difficult to learn this procedure, and I very rapidly became
expert
at removing the foreskin from a newborn. I was able to do circumcisions
in
a very short amount of time -- four or five minutes. I did this at the
parents'
request, and I was oblivious to the infant's cry.

<P>Several years later into my pediatrics career, after having performed
perhaps
a hundred circumcisions, I became aware of the newborn's pain that I had
somehow managed to put out of my consciousness. I now know that every
baby that I circumcised cried and that I never responded to their pain. I
then
decided I was on their side; my job was to protect babies, not harm them.
It
was only then that I began my study of the foreskin, how it is unlike
any
tissue found elsewhere in the human body and accordingly, has special
functions. The doctors and others performing this procedure on newborn
babies do not know the pain they are causing nor do they appreciate the
functions of that unique bit of tissue.

<P>Billy Ray Boyd, in writing this book, will have a profound impact on a
ritual more than 2,000 years old that has been based on superstition,
tradition, and religious beliefs, with little basis in medicine. This
book
will change outmoded methods of thinking. Parents, doctors, and
religious
leaders will learn from this book and come away from it with regret that
this procedure was done to them and done by them.

<P>It is understandable that parents, doctors, and religious leaders have
always
wanted what is best for their children. It is only by changing this
practice
that we will stop hurting our babies in a manner that cannot be good for
them.
Circumcision not only destroys an important part of anatomy and,
therefore,
the male's physiology, but also psychologically and emotionally damages
him.

<P>Infants do feel pain. This has been proven without a doubt in many
recent
studies. To continue to perform this procedure on our babies with
medical
justification is a practice that should and will end. This book will make
that
end come sooner rather than later.
