"Realizing what circumcision took away from me has been
by far the most traumatic experience of my life. My worst
thoughts and fears were confirmed while I was reading <I>The
Joy of Uncircumcising!</I>, by Jim Bigelow, in a bookstore. I
realized I would never be able to experience the full range
of pleasure possible only with a whole normal penis with all
its nerve endings and moving parts. I began to sob. I bought
the book, raced home and read it from cover to cover, then
curled up in the fetal position and cried and grieved for
three days. If my parents felt they had to MARK MY BODY in
the name of Judaism, I would rather have been BRANDED ON MY
BUTTOCKS WITH THE STAR OF DAVID or HAD A FINGER CUT OFF than
to have had my penis butchered. Bris milah is a tradition
that violates the most basic of all human rights, the right
of every human being to his or her own intact body. When I
realized that Judaism cut me off from part of myself, I cut
myself off from Judaism. I reject and denounce Judaism --
and any other religion that mandates infant circumcision --
as sick, perverted and immoral. I would find it difficult to
forgive anyone who had any role in permitting or carrying
out my circumcision. Anyone who continues to circumcise
babies today should be tried and imprisoned. No one -- <I>no
one</I> -- should be allowed to get away with this. CUT A BOY,
GO TO JAIL. PERIOD! I fantasize about revenge on the mohel
who circumcised me and take comfort in knowing he has
probably died of old age. One of the main reasons I'm active
in the intact baby movement is to vent my rage in a positive
way and not end up in prison. I've put a MOHEL=MENGELE sign
across the back of my car, along with the six anti-circumcision 
bumper stickers there already. I make no
apologies for what I've said. I'm not anti-Jewish. I'm 
anti-circumcision. Anyone who can't see that bris milah is wrong
is blinded by history, tradition, and religious dogma."
