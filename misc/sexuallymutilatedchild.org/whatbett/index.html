<blockquote>

If we wanted to mess up boys' heads,
what better way to do it than to
flood their baby brains with pain chemicals 
(e.g., cortisol)
by clamping their genitals and slicing 
part of them off?

<P>If we wanted to teach boys that their wishes don't matter,
what better way to do it than to cut a healthy, normal,
pleasurable part of their body off when they are too young to 
protect themselves?

<P>If we wanted to shame a boy, what better way 
than to disfigure him for life? 

<P>If we wanted to teach boys they are second-class citizens,
what better way
than by making female circumcision a 
felony but insisting
that male circumcision "doesn't matter"? 

<P>If we wanted to teach boys that their pain can easily be
ignored, what better way than to joke about taking a
knife to their most precious private parts? 

<P>If we wanted to enrage a boy, what better way than to 
cut off his "man-hood,"
then dismiss his complaints with "It was for your own good"?  

<P>If we wanted to teach boys they are "born defective," what
better way than to "fix" them right after they are born, 
like cutting off puppy dog tails? 

<P>If we wanted to give boys a reason for suicide, what better
way than to make sure the only way they can be whole again 
is through premature reincarnation? 

<P>If we wanted to teach boys they are unworthy of love, 
what better way than to make sure they can never make love 
with a complete sexual nervous system, with all its moving parts? 

<P>If we wanted to foster an endless cycle of boy-child abuse,
what better way than to make it so that for fathers to feel okay, 
they must make sure their sons lack like them? 

<P>If we wanted to devalue boys, what better way than to
denigrate their wholeness by calling them dirty or 
funny-looking, then telling these lies to partial boys so they can
tease the whole ones?
 
<P>If we wanted to teach boys that hurting others is okay, 
what better way than to needlessly wound them, 
then tell them that cutting healthy, normal
males is not an issue of right or wrong? 

<P>If we wanted to frustrate a boy, what better way than to take
away his "funskin," while his friends use theirs for privacy, 
protection and pleasuring -- as will their lovers later in life? 

<P>If we wanted to constantly remind boys that we can do whatever
we want to them, what better way than to make sure every time they 
pee they see and touch a circum-scar? 

<P>What better way to teach boys that their bodies are not sacred 
than to torture and mutilate their sex organs?

<P><b><I>When advocating for the bodies, minds and souls of boys, 
respecting and protecting their bodies comes first!</I></b>
