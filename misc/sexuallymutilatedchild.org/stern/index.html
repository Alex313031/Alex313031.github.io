Howard Stern is the first -- and still the only -- 
mega-celebrity to publicly and repeatedly take an appropriately 
outraged, uncompromising, zero-tolerance stand against  
the sexual mutilation of children and babies.

<P>His statements below were transcribed from his
radio show by Tony Shale.

<P>Thank you, Howard Stern. <I>Thank you.</I>

<P>Parents should not be
allowed to make this decision. It should not be up to parental
consent. If somebody wants to get a circumcision, let them do it
when they're an adult. Seriously. It should be stopped, it
should be against the law. It’s as barbaric as what goes on in
Africa. There is no reason for circumcision, PERIOD!

<P>And I’ll tell you what it is. Most men want their sons to
look like themselves. So this keeps going. It keeps going on
and on and on. It is so barbaric. And they are saying now
people are starting to take a second look at this. And they say
that they believe in the future it will be more common to
see uncircumcised men in gym class because people are really
starting to wake up to this. It is probably the biggest form of
child abuse going on in this country right now.

<P>I tell you, if I had a son, I would never allow him to be
circumcised. Never! Never! NEVER ALLOW IT! NEVER!

<P>And these Jews who are doing it are wrong, and the goyem
[non-Jews] that are doing it are wrong. Everyone’s wrong.

<P>It is wrong. Stop the practice NOW! IMMEDIATELY!

<P>Class action suit against doctors. This is the only way
you’ll get them to stop ... no matter who gives consent. 
Parents have no right to say. PARENTS ARE OUT OF THEIR MINDS.
They don’t think things through. They all just go along.

<P>[To a mohel about the Bible] 
I’m telling you, Sir, this is a BARBARIC process.  And
everyone has been so BRAINWASHED.
I don’t think a book is bad if it tells you not to
kill someone. But a book is bad if it’s telling you to mutilate
young boys and to cut off their penises ... That’s
bad. You’re in the business of mutilating young boys, Sir.  And I
think you should be arrested!

<P>Every thirty seconds in this country a baby is
circumcised. It is absolutely retarded to mutilate. It’s
retarded to mutilate young boys. If
suddenly there was a law in this country passed, or some sort of
ritual that everyone started doing about cutting women’s
clitorises off -- it’s being done in Africa -- I mean could you 
imagine the absurdity? Somehow people bought into this. 

<P>I know 
my penis was mutilated. They hold you down and without any 
anesthesia whatsoever, they cut it off. 
And they say the kids go into shock.

<P>It’s really the biggest crime being committed by parents
against their children. And I know if I had a son, I would not
even stop to think about it.

<P>There’s nothing natural about it. You know, I had this
revelation. I was standing there. I was reading stuff off the
Internet. I said, "Oh, my God! I’ve been mutilated!"

<P>We are used to seeing [circumcised penises]. But do you know
that most of the world is uncircumcised? It’s just in this country, 
there’s some sort of weird hang-up
about the look of it or something. But it’s totally natural to
look that way. You know what I did this
weekend? I watched porno with uncircumcised guys. They don’t
look that weird. It was straight porno ... I was
just sitting there watching, and the guy was uncircumcised.

<P>What I’m saying is -- and I’m saying to all people out
there -- we have to stop the butchering of our boys.

<P>I don’t care what anyone says. I’m going to continue to
speak out on this. I am completely pissed off that I’m
circumcised. And they say that the penis is LONGER or at
least gives the appearance of being longer, if you’re
uncircumcised.

<P>It is MUTILATION. There is no benefit whatsoever.
I swear to you, it is wrong. Think about it. Really sit
down and contemplate what I am saying. It is so wrong. There is
a REASON for that foreskin being there.

<B>October 21, 1998</b>

<P>Why do people circumcise their sons in this country? 
I have no clue. I am circumcised and I tell you
something, I despise it. I despise it. I despise it. 

<P>I didn’t even become aware that I was hostile to the fact
that my parents circumcised me until recently. I thought about
it and I said, my God, they’re talking about all that skin tissue
removed. It is all nerves, it all adds to your sexual
pleasure, this is the way you are born for a reason. It cuts
down on, not only sexually transmitted diseases, but other kinds
of diseases. And its perfectly clean. We’ve been conditioned to
think that men aren’t clean who are uncircumcised, and it’s
wrong. And it’s wrong to put kids through this kind of pain. 
There’s no reason for it.

<P>And then there are some Jews who say it is a covenant with
God. Well you know what? Forget about it! What covenant with
God?

<P>It's absurd. The whole thing's absurd. It's disgusting. 
It's about time it stopped. It should be against the law. The
same way you couldn't go cut off a boy's whole penis and decide
to make him a girl. It's the same exact thing. Let me decide as
an adult. If I want a circumcision, I'll go get one. It's
barbaric. And they don't even give these kids any kind of
anesthesia ... Some of them lock up and go into
seizure ... and now this kid [Dustin Evans] is dead. The parents 
are completely devastated. For what? It was a healthy baby. 
It’s out of control.

<P>A lot of women in Africa -- and I've been screaming about
this -- are circumcised by their fathers 
because they don't want them to have sexuality ... I hate
that men are circumcised in this country. I'm against that as
well ... I'm against male or female circumcision. It's my
issue.

<br>
<br>

<B>January 8, 1999</b>

<P>Well this woman has no clitoris, everybody, because of
the backward ways of Africa. And let me tell you something: 
this country is no better. They circumcise men all the time here
and it’s wrong. It's f---ing wrong! When people hear that women 
have their clitorises cut off in Africa, they go, "Oh, how horrible." 
Meanwhile why are men mutilated here every day?

<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>February 4, 1999</b>

<P>I am telling you -- America, pay attention to me -- stop
these circumcisions. It is mutilation of boys. It is no
different than what they do in Africa to women with these
clitoridectomies. We are butchering our young.

<P>The body is built a certain way to function. This idea that
man created, circumcision, you KNOW is wrong! You KNOW it's
wrong! What do you think? God -- Oh! -- If there was a God -- 
assume we're going to try to improve -- in other words
he wants you -- he's sending us to doctors to -- Oh! --
Circumcision came about because men are so sexually active that
somewhere along the line they tried to tame men's libido. That's
how it got started. Well guess what. It doesn't stop. All it
does is mutilate.

<br>

<b>March 2, 1999</b>

<P>This is the mutilation of babies. And let me tell
you something ... it should be against the law.

<P>THIS IS AN OUTRAGE! IT'S NOT EVEN A JOKE! IT'S AN OUTRAGE!  
IF I HAD A SON I WOULDN’T LET ANYONE NEAR HIM WITH A KNIFE!

<P>IT’S YOUR PENIS! IT’S WHAT YOU WERE BORN WITH. WHAT DO YOU
THINK? GOD WANTED YOU TO CUT THAT OFF? WHERE’S GOD TELLING
PEOPLE TO CUT THINGS OFF THEIR BODY? IT’S A SUPERSTITION!

<P>And when I meet these Jews who tell me it's a covenant with
God I want to take them and throw them out the window. Where's
God and where's the covenant?  

<P>Of course, it's mutilation.  That's like saying, "You know
what? If you cut off your arm you'll never get an ingrown nail
on your hand!" That's a great benefit!

<P>It should be against the law. I'm telling you right now, if
I was Governor Jesse Ventura or Governor Putaki or President
Clinton I would put into a bill that it is against the law to
mutilate children. They're all worried about protecting friggin'
children except during this, because  everyone is a big pussy.

<P>Hey, let me ask you something. If I took your son, all right? 
I strap him to a table when he's first born. I mutilate him, I
do experiments on him, mutilate him in some way. Now he is not
going to remember this mutilation. You have no way of gauging
their pain. But if you don't think that's a trauma to the
nervous system and to the entire being ... 
You don't think that shapes your feelings toward people? To have
that happen the first thing you come into this world ... that
it's not trusting? Absolutely!

<br>
<br>
<br>

<B>March 16, 1999</b>

<P>We have all been mutilated. Our penises have been
mutilated at birth. They say that the uncircumcised penis, I
mean there’s thousands of nerve endings that are cut off. You
are literally, it’s like in Africa they mutilate women and we
think that’s barbaric, but we’re doing the same thing to men!

<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>March 26, 1999</b>

<P>It’s a barbaric practice and it should be stopped in
this country and should be outlawed ... to me it’s a more serious 
crime that what’s going on in
Kosovo or wherever the hell that is. We should be involved in the
mutilation of young boys? I mean what kind of country are we?
What kind of country is this? It’s backward. It’s barbaric.
