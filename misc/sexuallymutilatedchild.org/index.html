<blockquote>
Consent given by a person of good will to circumcise a baby can
never be -- and never has been -- informed. The only informed
choice possible for a person of good will to make about the
foreskin of
a baby is the choice that the baby himself, when old enough to
understand what his foreskin is and what would have been done to
it he 
had been circumcised, is most likely to be glad was made for him.
That
choice, beyond any reasonable doubt, is to let him keep his
foreskin intact.
