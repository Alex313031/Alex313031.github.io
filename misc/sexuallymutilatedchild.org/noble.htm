<P>"A book to reassure the young boy and his family that for his penis to 
remain intact as nature
intended is the best way. The incidence of circumcision in the United 
States decreased from 85% in 1980
to 58% in 1990, but has since increased to 61%. Female circumcision, as 
commonly done in Africa and
parts of the Middle East, invariably arouses horror and revulsion among 
Americans, but most American
boys, unlike their counterparts in Europe and Scandinavia, also suffer 
genital mutilation without their
consent. 

<P>"This 16-page book of photographs has simple text intended 
primarily for the 3 to 6 year-old boy.
The important function of the foreskin and the gradual process of natural 
retraction is shown. He will be
happy to learn that his body is normal and that he has retained what so 
many of his friends have lost. In
the adult, this is an average of 12 square inches of erogenous tissue!

<P>"Please help to educate expectant
parents who are considering their son's sexual amputation with little 
knowledge about the structure and function of the normal penis."
