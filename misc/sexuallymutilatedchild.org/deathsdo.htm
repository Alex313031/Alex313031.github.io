"The simple facts are that deaths do occur
as a result of circumcision, and that no one knows
how many." (Circumcision: What Every Parent
Should Know, by Anne Briggs, p. 90) 
<P>
"The editors of Family Health commented
(1972) that deaths due to circumcision may be
attributed to other causes -- pneumonia, blood
poisoning, liver or kidney failure, etc." (Circumcision:
An American Health Fallacy, by Edward Wallerstein,
p. 148)
<P> 
"[T]here are more deaths each year from
complications of circumcision than from cancer of the
penis." (Sydney S. Gellis, MD, quoted by Wallerstein,
p.148) 
<P> 
"[I]f circumcision were made compulsory,
the circumciser would be protected whenever he
happens to cripple or kill the little boy he operates on--
a  complication  that is not so very uncommon ... In
1951, I witnessed the autopsy of an infant who had
died from an infected circumcision--a death rendered
even more tragic because the mother had tried to
persuade the obstetrician to spare her infant this
ordeal." ("The Unkindest Cut of All," by John M.
Foley, MD, Fact, July 1966)
<P>
"If morbidity data are frequently not entered
in the chart, presumably to avoid malpractice suits,
then it is even less likely that a death will be
attributed to circumcision, for the same reason."
(Wallerstein, p. 149) 
<P> 
"Babies have died from post-circumcision
hemorrhage. Since Biblical times the Jews have had a
law that if two sons of the same mother bled to
death following circumcision, any future sons were
exempt from the ritual." (Circumcision: The Painful
Dilemma, by Rosemary Romberg, p. 207) 
<P> 
"Over the period 1942-1947 in England there
were 16 deaths per year related to anesthetics used
for circumcision." (George W. Kaplan, MD, quoted by
Romberg, p. 224)
<P> 
"About 1,350,000 newborn American males
are circumcised annually, and about 230 of them die
as a result of this operation." (Sex by Prescription,
by Thomas S. Szasz, MD, Syracuse University Press,
1990) 
<P>
[How many <i>almost</i> die?]
<P>
"Could the trauma of circumcision as
remembered in the infant brain, be the reason, or a
contributing factor, that would make a small
percentage of babies give up and stop living?"
(Romberg, p. 299) 
<P> 
"That it is necessary to speculate wildly
about the frequency of significant complications [of
infant circumcision] is nothing less than scandalous.
Risk estimates range from 0 to 1 in 100; deaths from
0 to more than 225 annually. A nationwide study of
this question is obviously in order. If the risk is very
low, this should be proved. If the risk is high, it should
be exposed. That such a study has not been
conducted suggests that the issue may be too hot to
handle." (Wallerstein, p. 153)
