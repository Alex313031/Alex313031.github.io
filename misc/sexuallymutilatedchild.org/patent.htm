ABSTRACT: A method and apparatus employing a high-frequency electric 
current having a bell as one electrode inserted within the foreskin 
and having a relatively fine stainless steel wire tightly encircling
the foreskin at the position where the foreskin is to be cut. The
wire serves as the other electrode and overlies an opposed area of the
bell within the foreskin. A source of high-frequency current has its
leads connected to the bell and wire, and current of cutting
frequency, suitably timed for the cut to be made, is applied to effect
the cut beneath the wire. The bell has electrical insulation applied to
its exterior surface and preferably has heat-insulation material applied
to its interior surface.
