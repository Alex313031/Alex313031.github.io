<b><big><big>Facing Circumcision: 
<br>Eight Physicians Tell Their Stories</big>
<br>and reveal the ethical dilemmas of 
<br>physicians who circumcise newborns</big></b>

<br>
<br>
<br>

Seven family practice physicians and one emergency room
physician in Santa Fe, New Mexico, struggle with their
consciences as they examine the ethical and human rights
issues of infant circumcision. Three of the physicians
tell why they stopped circumcising. The rest tell why
they continue to circumcise or to advocate circumcision 
and discuss what considerations might lead them to change
their minds.

<P>For every parent considering circumcision for their
newborn, every physician who circumcises and every
medical student.

<P>"The film is well...the most convincing thing I've seen
yet. The doctors are amazingly articulate. I have always
said, we must let them tell their truth. Surely this
work was divinely inspired." --Jody McLaughlin, Editor, 
The Compleat Mother Magazine

<P>"Doctors communicating frankly and openly about the practice
of circumcision. A compelling video. It should be viewed by 
all potential parents and medical care personnel." --Dean Edell, 
MD, Medical Journalist
