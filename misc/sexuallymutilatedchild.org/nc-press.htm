ROUTINE CIRCUMCISION NOT RECOMMENDED, AAP SAYS
</center>
</b>

<P>After analyzing almost 40 years of medical research on
circumcision, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
has stated that "the existing scientific evidence
[demonstrating] potential medical benefits of newborn
male circumcision [is] not sufficient to recommend newborn
circumcision." The AAP's new policy statement was
published in the March issue of the AAP's journal, <I>Pediatrics</I>.

<P>Since the AAP can find no medical reason to recommend routine
circumcision, NOCIRC calls upon the AAP to:

<ul>

<li>educate its members about the erogenous, sexual, protective,
and immunological functions of the foreskin;

<P><li>educate its members about the care of the normal intact penis;

<P><li>acknowledge that no amount of analgesia prevents circumcision
pain;

<P><li>address the psychological, sexual, and social effects of
circumcision;

<P><li>uphold the first maxim of medical practice, "First, do no
harm," by recommending that the foreskins of babies routinely
be kept intact.

</ul>

<P>NOCIRC director Marilyn Milos said, "Now that the American
Academy of Pediatrics has aligned itself more closely with
medical organizations worldwide by not recommending routine
male circumcision, the already declining circumcision rate in
the U.S. should drop dramatically."
