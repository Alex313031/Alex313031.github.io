     "I'm against it [circumcision] because my son was locally
given some medicine and he was screaming and screaming and
screaming and I couldn't get in to him ... When he came out I
thought he was a basket case." (Woman in audience, Phil Donahue
show on circumcision and foreskin restoration, 6/17/87) 
<P> 
     "I have two sons, one circumcised, one not, and I'll tell
you, it has affected my whole family ... One is very well
adjusted, the one that just so happens to be not circumcised, and
the one that is circumcised is not ... I think it is [because
he's circumcised] ... My oldest [circumcised] son has not
adjusted to his personal parts very well ... [He] Does not
like to be looked at or touched." (Woman caller, Phil Donahue
show on circumcision and foreskin restoration, 6/17/87)
<P>
     "Nothing had prepared me -- nothing could have prepared 
me -- for what I was about to witness or for the realization that
I had let the same thing happen to my own three sons." (Marilyn
Milos, RN, founder and director of NOCIRC, upon seeing a baby
being circumcised during a nurses' training class. "Infant
Circumcision: What I Wish I Had Known")
<P>
     "[I]f I could take one thing back in my life of many
mistakes, it would be the circumcision of my sons -- the gravest
mistake of all!" (Marilyn Milos, RN, Founder/Director, NOCIRC,
from her inscription in the copy of Sexual Mutilations: A Human
Tragedy she gave to her youngest son)
<P>
     "If there was only one thing I could take back and redo, it
would be that [the circumcision of her second son]. But I can't."
(Carole Alley, RN, The Nurses of St. Vincent: Saying "No" to
Circumcision, [video] by Barry Ellsworth)
<P>
     "I spoke at the Third International Symposium on
Circumcision about my experience and was shocked and sickened as
I became aware, during the symposium, of the parallels between
what was done to me and what I had been brainwashed and
pressured, against all my maternal instincts and common sense,
into letting still another genital mutilator do to my own baby
son." (Carla Miller, Founder, Patients In ARMS, "My Own Nightmare
and Fight for Justice," Deeper Into Circumcision: An Invitation
to Awareness, compiled and edited by John A. Erickson) 
<P>
     "Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you talk me out of it?
Why didn't someone stop me?" (Mother and health care provider
after watching a video about male and female circumcision after
her son had been circumcised. "Quotations and Comments by
North Dakotans Since 1992 Regarding the Ritual of Routine Infant
Circumcision," compiled with comments by Duane Voskuil, PhD, NOCIRC
of North Dakota/ Bismarck.) 
<P>
     "What incomprehensible force brought me from this beautiful,
untraumatized birth at home to a strange doctor's office one week
later sitting there frightened and reluctant, holding my
sleeping, peaceful, trusting newborn infant? ... The trauma and
torture inflicted upon this tiny, helpless little being were to
come back and haunt me again and again." (Rosemary Romberg,
"Circumcision," Circumcision: The Rest of the Story (A Selection
of Articles, Letters, and Recources, 1979-1993, edited by Peggy
O'Mara, Mothering Magazine, 1993)
<P>
     "I was never to see those beautiful, mystic, Leboyer
newborn-baby smiles again." (Rosemary Romberg, after the
circumcision of her third son, 8 days old. Circumcision: The
Painful Dilemma, p. xx)
