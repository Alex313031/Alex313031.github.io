Schonfeld. The program includes graphic footage of the
procedure and images which will inevitably distress some
viewers." Also: bris (baby's intact penis, mohel's sharpened
pointed thumbnail, mohel forcing baby's foreskin back,
slipping shield over foreskin, cutting foreskin off, then
sucking blood from screaming baby's penis through a glass
tube); the baby's non-Jewish father watching a video of the
bris just described; 5-month old smiling intact Jewish baby;
segment about pain study; "One Baby's Story" and "The
Stories They Fail to Mention." First aired in London,

<b>Rabbi David Singer</b>: "The last but one [circumcision]
that I did, the parents were telling me that before the
circumcision the baby was very fractious and was always
crying at night and very unsettled, and the night after the
brit was done, the baby spent a quiet night, he's sticking
to a three-, three-and-a-half, four-hour feeding routine, so
they were quite delighted it could be done."

<P><B>Jewish woman on street</B>: "There's no pain. It's a baby,
a week old."

<P><B>Another Jewish women on street</B>: "I've been at many and
not one child has suffered."

<P><B>Dr. Adrian Lloyd Thomas, Pediatrician</B> (in response to
being asked about circumcision without anesthesia): "You can
see there a very definite response from the baby as soon the
forceps are applied to the foreskin. The baby is holding his
breath, shivering. Infants having an operation may actually
experience more pain than adults do having the same
procedure, and the reason for this is that the control
mechanisms, particularly in the spinal cord, which are
highly developed to damp down and suppress pain in a mature
adult nervous system, are not so well developed in the small
baby. So, the pain signals travel through uncontrolled,
unsuppressed ... I think it would be unwise to draw that
conclusion [that the baby stopped crying because the pain
was over]. I'd more prefer to think that the experience had
been so overwhelming that the baby can't ... put up a
fight anymore ... My personal feeling as a pediatric
anesthetist is that it is not ethical to perform 
circumcisions without some form of topical anesthesia." 

<P><B>Narrator</B>: "[T]he British medical consensus is that
newborn circumcision is not medically warranted, that the
baby has been made to give up a protective covering of
erogenous tissue, and that the glans of his penis, an
internal organ biologically, will now be exposed."

<P><B>Woman pediatric surgeon</B>: "Some other complications ... 
occur later ... when children have realized that they
have been circumcised, they feel psychologically that
something is grossly wrong with their sex life."

<P><B>Man</B>: "My penis, instead of ... hanging straight up
and down so that the top faces forwards and the under-neath
faces back ... the underneath will face to the right or ... 
will start facing forwards so it describes a sort of
corkscrew twist to the left ... There is an interweaving
of the physical mutilation which I've had to live with for
nearly 50 years as well as the awareness that I have been
deprived of one of life's basic pleasures."

<P><B>Muslim man</B>: "I can remember ... blissfully flowing
along as a happy child when one day my father ... took 
me over to the hair-dresser ... I was thrust on the table
and circumcised .. a big shock ... the psychological
pain ... lasted on, the betrayal of trust ... I often
have nightmares of a pound of flesh taken off a live
horse ... I don't see in any way that my circumcision has
contributed to my cultural identity or racial identity. I
think it has been just a bit of a blot on my life."          

<P><B>African mother</B>: "He was taken to hospital ... a few
minutes later they [told us] that the child is dead." 

<P><B>Jewish woman</B>: "I've never heard of anybody in our 
family or in our circle of acquaintances who's ever lost 
a child as a result of bris ... and it's inconceivable
that it didn't happen. And of course when you start to look
at it and ask for the reasons for that silence, it's
obvious. You simply can't coerce somebody into doing some
thing ... to their children if [they] know that there is
the risk that their child might die or suffer injury." 

<P><B>James Hocksworth</B> (at hospital where his eleven-day-old
son, circumcised three days before by Rabbi Singer, had been
taken because of a severe infection of his circumcision
wound. [Rabbi Singer denied his procedure caused the
illness.]): "[W]hen we brought him in he needed oxygen
so badly that they ... gave him oxygen immediately and
that brought back the color in him. Once he'd been put in
the ward ... he turned grayish again ... looked like
death warmed up and ... they put him in an intensive care
unit ... I had thought it was a ... a qualified doctor
who was performing this. I hadn't been consulted by him at
all ... I believe he should have had my consent. I'm the
boy's father and if you saw him, you would never, ever do
this. Nobody could ever do this to their own child. He was
in so much pain. He was struggling to breathe ... There's
no need to go through that suffering ... he doesn't need
to have his penis cut at the end so that it's rubbing around
for days on end and he's in pain and screaming ... I think
it's disgraceful. He can't speak. He doesn't have the voice
to say  I don't like this and I don't want it.  He didn't
have the choice. He was eight days old and he gets thrown on
a table and he has the end of his penis cut off. I think
it's immoral and I think it's arrogant of the people who do
it to presume that they have the right to cut up other
people for the sake of religion."

<P><B>Jewish mother</B>: "I'm a Jewish mother. My son Max is
five months old and I refuse to have him circumcised. [I
told my mother,] 'I would do anything not to hurt you, my
parents, except hurt my child.'"

<P><B>Dr. Majid Katme, President, Islamic Medical Assoc.</B>:
"Is she, the mother or the father, are they really listening
and submitting to the teaching of their religion or are they
using their mind and questioning things?"

<P><b>Dr. Morris Sifman, Medical Officer, The Initiation
Society (Assoc. Jewish Circumcisers)</B>: "They [mohels] don't
want it filmed because, frankly, they distrust the media ... we 
are up against, all the time, the possibility of this
kind of thing happening which would damage the attitude of
some parents who might be uncertain of what they want to do ... 
If it would be found that circumcision is positively
harmful, perhaps we would think again. But I have no doubt -- I 
have not the slightest, <i>slightest</I> doubt -- that this
will never happen, because a commandment given by God is a
good commandment." 

<P><B>Dr. Jenny Goodman, Medical Doctor and 
Psychotherapist</B>: "None of us do it for medical reasons. We do it
because we fear being cast out from the tribe. But after
having done it, we comfort ourselves with these medical
myths ... If we could progress from sacrifice through
castration to circumcision, then we can continue to 
progress all the way away from any kind of physical injury."
