"Parents should be wary of anyone who tries to retract their
child's foreskin, and especially wary of anyone who wants to cut
it off. Human foreskins are in great demand for any number of
commercial enterprises, and the marketing of purloined baby
foreskins is a multimillion-dollar-a-year industry."

Since the 1980s, private hospitals have been involved in the business of
supplying discarded foreskins to private bio-research laboratories and
pharmaceutical companies who require human flesh as raw  research material.
They also supply foreskins to transnational corporations such as Advanced
Tissue Sciences of San Diego, California, [1] Organogenesis, [2] and
BioSurface Technology, [3] who have recently emerged to reap new corporate
profits from the sale of marketable products made from harvested human
foreskins. In 1996 alone, Advanced Tissue Sciences could boast of a healthy
$663.9 million market capitalization performance.[4]

The after market for human foreskin is where the real money is made.
Foreskins are sold to biomedical companies, which use them in the
manufacture of insulin. They're also sold to middlemen, who package them for
sale to research companies that in turn use them for biochemical analysis.
Corporations such as Advanced Tissue Sciences (ATS), Organogenesis,
BioSurface Technology, Genzyme, and Ortec International are taking cells
from amputated foreskins and experimenting with artificial skin. Products
like Dermagraft-TC, which sells for about $3,000 per square foot, are grown
from the cells in infant foreskins and used as a temporary wound covering
for burn patients. One foreskin contains enough genetic material to grow
250,000 square feet of skin.

ICCPR's [International Covenant on Civil and Political

of American medical hospitals and medical professionals colluding
with scientific agencies <I>harvesting</I> neonatal foreskins for
skin grafts, i.e., as compulsory organ donation. 
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Associations
like Organogenesis (Canton, MA) have received approval from the USA's
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its foreskin-based
GraftskinTM, and has served Western Pennsylvania Hospital, with
additional studies conducted at Yale University and Boston
University (Stephen Brewer, New Skin Twin Life- and Look-Saver.

Another profit-oriented tissue
engineering company, Advanced Tissue Sciences (La Jolla, CA),
retrieves foreskins from hospitals so one foreskin can create
250,000 square feet of dermis ... [T]he annual market for
dermis could be $1 billion to $2 billion. Advanced Tissue
Sciences has sold about $1 million worth of cultured dermis to
Proctor & Gamble, Helene Curtis, and other such businesses for
pre-market testing. Advanced Tissue Science's foreskin-derived
merchandise held a $32 million stock offering in the beginning of
1992 (Julie Pitta. Biosynthetics. Forbes 10 May 1993: 170-171).

Companies See $1.5b Market in Replacement Skin Products. This
article reveals another enterprise of genital mutilation-cum-scientific 
advance: BioSurface Technology of Cambridge, MA. All
three companies face no shortage of hoarding and retailing
foreskins, and are motivated by individuals like Dr. Tania
Phillips, professor of dermatology at Boston University of
Medicine, insisting foreskin gathering and cultivating is
scientifically and technologically "very promising." (Ronald
Rosenberg. 19 October 1992: 22-23).

THE WOODLANDS, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 16, 1995--
LifeCell Corporation (Nasdaq:LIFC) today announced the culturing
of human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes onto AlloDerm(R),
LifeCell's universal dermal tissue graft, to form a fully
differentiated, epidermal skin layer which was then successfully
grafted to an animal model. The research demonstrates the
potential for generating a durable, off-the-shelf cultured skin
graft product which exhibits reduced complications from
blistering or scarring, according to Paul Frison, president and
chief executive officer ... CONTACT: LifeCell Corporation, The

Lajolla, California. A U.S. Food and Drug (FDA) Committee
recommended FDA approval of Dermagraft, artificial skin made from
circumcised baby foreskins to treat diabetic foot ulcers, on
condition that manufacturer Advanced Tissue Sciences, Inc., do a
post-marketing study. NOCIRC's attorney was given just five
minutes to speak to the Committee in defense of the babies whose
foreskins are cut off a marketed without their consent.

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new product made of human skin
cells won FDA approval for use in treating certain kinds of
wounds Tuesday [May 26, 1998].
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The product, called Apligraf, is made of human skin cells
mixed with collagen from cattle. It is made by Canton,
Massachusetts-based Organogenesis.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The Food and Drug Administration said it had approved the
product for use in treating venous skin ulcers, which are hard
to heal because of a lack of blood flow to the skin.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     "This condition is estimated to affect thousands of
Americans each year, and its treatment often requires multiple
surgeries," the FDA said in a statement.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     "Although Apligraf will not eliminate the need for standard
treatment, it use may enhance and shorten the healing process."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. has global marketing rights
to Apligraf, the company said in a statement.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In addition to venous leg ulcers, Apligraf has been studied
in burns and in skin surgery. A trial is under way in diabetic
ulcers and one is expected to begin in bedsores, also known as
pressure sores, later this year.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Experts say tissue engineering is starting to transform the
way patients with flesh wounds are being treated.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Apligraf is made with live cells from the foreskin of a
newborn's penis -- used because babies are regularly circumcised
and the tissue is young and available -- mixed with tissue from
a cow.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     "Its special composition allows it to provide wound
protection and to foster the growth of healthy new skin," the
FDA said.

I wrote to the American Cancer Society May 1, 1987, and
asked if it was true that one of the sources of the interferon
used in cancer research in this country was the foreskins of
circumcised human babies. A few days later, John Stevens at the
American Cancer Society called and told me that the answer to my
question was yes.

<P>How much does one infant foreskin sell for? (I received an
email January 1997 from someone who prefers to remain anonymous
who said that the going rate for infant foreskins at a large
hospital in the greater San Diego area was $35 each -- and that
"ethical" doctors deducted that amount from their circumcision
fees.)

<P>How many foreskins have been sold?

<P>Who sells them? Doctors? Midwives? Mohels? Hospitals?

<P>Who buys them? 

<P>Are there any "middle men," and if so, who are they?

<P>Are the foreskins sold "per foreskin" or by weight? (Do
circumcisers have a financial incentive to cut off as much skin
as possible?)

<P>Is a foreskin still marketable if it has been covered with
or injected with anesthetic? (Do circumcisers have a financial
incentive not to use an anesthetic?)

<P>Are some types of foreskin more in demand than others?
(White, Black, Latino, Asian?)

<P>Are parents told that their baby's foreskin will be sold?
Are they <I>asked</I> if their baby's foreskin <I>may</I> be
sold? 

<P>Who is the legal owner of a baby's foreskin after it's been
cut off? (Who is the legal owner of a baby's foreskin
<I>before</I> it's cut off?)

<P>Is it ethical to cut off a baby's foreskin, charge his
parents for the operation, sell his foreskin without telling his
parents, and keep the money? Is it legal?

<P>Are the foreskins of children and adults being sold too?

<P>Are other parts of people's bodies being cut off -- or out -- and 
sold without their knowledge or consent?    

<P>If someone cuts part of another person's body off -- or out -- 
and sells it without obtaining signed legal consent from the
person cut, and the person who buys it makes money from it, who
does that money rightfully belong to?

<P>Do Diane Sawyer and Bill Kurtis (<I>Investigative Reports</I>)
know about this?
