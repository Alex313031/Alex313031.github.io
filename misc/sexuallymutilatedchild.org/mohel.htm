<blockquote>

Shabbath 19:2
<br>They may perform on the Sabbath all things that are needful 
for circumcision: excision, tearing, sucking [the wound], 
and putting thereon a bandage and cumin. If this had not 
been pounded up on the eve of the Sabbath a man may chew 
it with his teeth and then apply it.

<blockquote>

Shabbat 133B
<br>II.1. 

<br>A. Suck [out the wound]:

<br>B. Said R. Pappa, "A Surgeon who didn't suck out the wound - 
that is a source of danger, and we throw him out."

<br>C. So what else is new? Obviously, since we are prepared to 
desecrate the Sabbath on that account, it is certainly dangerous 
not to do it!

<br>D. What might you have supposed? That this blood is stored up. 
So we are informed that it is the result of the wound, and in 
the status of a bandage and cumin: Just as when one doesn't put 
on a bandage and cumin, there is danger, so here, too, if one 
doesn't do it, there is danger.

quoted.]

<P>"There are three stages required for the performance
of a ritually correct circumcision in Jewish law:
the removal of the foreskin;
the tearing of the underlying membraene so as to expose
the glans completely; and the sucking away of the blood,
m'tsitsah." Roger V. Pavey. <I>The Kindest Cut of All</I>.
Bognor Regis, W. Sussex: New Horizon. 1981. pp. 87-88.

<P>"The method to be adopted is laid down thus:
'One excises the foreskin, [that is] the entire skin
covering the glans, so that the corona is laid bare.
Afterwards, one tears with the finger-nail the soft 
membrane underneath the skin, turning it to the sides 
until the flesh of the glans appears. Thereafter, one 
sucks the membrane until the blood is extracted from
the [more] remote places, so that no danger [to the
infant] may ensue; and any circumciser who does not
carry out the sucking procedure is to be removed [from
his office].' . . . The operation itself, then, 
consists of three distinct acts: the excision of the
prepuce; the laceration of the mucous membrane covering
the glans; and the sucking of the blood from the 
interior of the wound." Immanuel Jakobovits.

<P>"The baby cried, blood flowed on to his penis and - 
as the rabbi had predicted - Graham [the godfather] 
did not faint. The rabbi then bent over the baby 
and sucked the wound. I know this sounds awful, 
but it is part of the Jewish tradition. It's supposed 
to help the healing." Jack Shamash. "My Son on the 
Cutting Edge." <I>Independent</I> (London), no. 3,797 
(Thursday, December 17, 1998): p. R8.

<P>"And what of the practice of sucking the bleeding penis?
While condemning the procedure, some physicians contend
that it was used to stop bleeding.<small>47</small>
Not only is there
little evidence for this theory, but it was also a
largely ineffective method. Furthermore, even in antiquity,
surgeons had better methods to stop bleeding, such as
pressure, instruments, and medication.<small>48</small>
According to
Dr. H. Speert (1953), Maimonides 'staunchly supported
this procedure [sucking the bleeding penis] as a
prophylactic measure against inflammation.'"<small>49</small>

<P>"<I>mezizah</I> -- Hebrew term for the third step in the Jewish
circumcision ritual, in which the mohel applies his mouth to the 
freshly circumcised infant's penis and sucks up the first drops 
of blood. In more recent times this procedure has been carried
out via a tube, as infections, venereal disease, and tuberculosis, 
sometimes resulting in the death of the infant, have occurred
due to contamination of the wound. Most Jewish circumcisors
today have eliminated this step from the circumcision ritual. 
Critics have attributed sadistic and homosexual implications to 
this practice, while defenders claim that this was simply all that 
was known during ancient times to stop the bleeding."

<P>"The traditional practice of metzitzah b'peh, which 
has its roots in the earliest history of the Jewish 
people and has survived unchanged to the present time, 
should be viewed with great respect. It is spoken of 
very positively in the Jewish literature on circumcision 
both as an essential part of the ritual and as a health 
measure which prevents infection and promotes healing."
