<h2><center>To Persons of Good Will Who Circumcise Babies</center></h2>

<BR>

Before you mar the body, wound the spirit, and censor
the life of another human being who is helpless to stop you,
by severing him from a means of perceiving, experiencing,
sharing and enjoying his existence, and robbing him of what
has been described as one of nature's sublimest gifts -- the
experience of having a foreskin -- ask a random assortment
of men who have had that experience one question:
<ul><ul>
      If anyone had started to circumcise you when you were
a baby -- even at your parents' request -- would you want
him or her to have been stopped, by force if necessary?
</ul></ul>
      Then ask yourself: What policy about the foreskins of
babies is appropriate to a person of good will who knows how
most men whose foreskins are intact would answer that
question?
<P>
<BR>
<B>To the American Medical Association</B>:
<P>
      Should the highest medical authority and court of
appeals of a civilized country tolerate the routine
amputation and irreversible destruction, by its own members,
of a healthy, sensitive, normally functioning part of a
human being's body, that is rightfully his and that he
instinctively wants to keep intact, at a time in his life when he
can't understand what is being done to him -- or why -- and
can't speak for or protect himself?
<P>
<BR>
<B>To the American Academy of Pediatrics</B>:
<P>
      How can anyone who subscribes to the "Do no harm"
ethic embraced by every medical society in the civilized
world, justify cutting off part a baby's penis that so many
males who had that part of their penises cut off when they
were babies would rather have intact -- and that so many
males who have that part of their penises intact value beyond
price?
<P>
<BR>
<B>To the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology</B>:
<P>
      Some doctors who circumcise babies now acknowledge
that when a baby screams, struggles, vomits, defecates and
lapses into coma when his foreskin is clamped, slit, torn,
crushed and sliced, he's in pain. 
<P>
      When will they acknowledge that a baby's screams are
his only way of telling them what any other male with a
knife at his penis would try to tell them: that he doesn't
want any of it cut off?
