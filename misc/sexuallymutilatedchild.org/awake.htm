<P>"First of its kind to reveal the adverse physical, sexual and 
psychological effects on men of a
surgery they did not choose. / It may be these males who provide 
the leadership needed to awaken the rest of the
nation from its circumcision coma." 

<P>Numerous drawings and photographs. 180+ pages. 338 references. 
<br>$25 ppd. Each additional copy: $15. From NOHARMM, POB 460795,

"Awareness that this was done to you is something that a lot of 
circumcised guys more or
less stumble upon. If he reads enough though, he eventually learns that 
his circumcision was not
only unnecessary, but deprived him of fully functioning genitalia. This 
widespread ignorance before
such an awareness occurs is a kind of mental circumcision. Later, when he 
gets the message that
people are uncomfortable talking about it, and he is treated like it's 
not important or that he
shouldn't question it, a man becomes aware of being cut off from society, 
and then a deeper circumcision of the soul sets in."
