Newborn Circumcision Are Rare"</h2>

<h3>And other rarely quoted excerpts

<BR>1989 Report of the Task Force on Circumcision,</h3></center>
<P>
<BR>
"Meatitis [inflammation of the external urethral meatus]
is more common in circumcised boys." 
<P> 
      "Evidence regarding the relationship of circumcision to
sexually transmitted diseases is conflicting." 
<P> 
      "[O]ne study shows ... a higher incidence of
nonspecific urethritis in circumcised men." 
<P> 
      "Infants undergoing circumcision without anesthesia
demonstrate physiologic responses suggesting they are
experiencing pain." 
<P> 
      "Pain pathways as well as the cortical and subcortical
centers necessary for pain perception are well developed by
the third trimester." 
<P> 
      "Behavioral changes include a cry pattern indicating
distress during the circumcision procedure and changes 
in ... infant-maternal interaction for the first few hours
after circumcision." 
<P> 
      "[R]eported experience with local anesthesia in
newborn circumcision is limited, and the procedure is not
without risk." 
<P> 
      "The exact incidence of postoperative complications is
unknown." 
<P> 
      "Deaths attributable to newborn circumcision are 
rare." [How rare? With this statement the AAP
acknowledges that some babies do die as a result of being
circumcised. This fact was omitted from the AAP's March 6,
1989 News Release about circumcision. Why?] 
<P> 
      "Local anesthesia adds an element of risk." 
<P> 
      "Circumferential anesthesia may be hazardous." 
<P> 
       "[P]arents should be fully informed of the possible
benefits and potential risks." 
<P> 
      "Local anesthesia (dorsal penile nerve block) may reduce
the observed physiologic response to newborn circumcision. It
also has its own inherent risks." 
<P> 
      "Newborn circumcision has potential medical benefits and
advantages as well as disadvantages and risks."
