<P>The last photograph above (vaginal speculum stretching
residual penile skin) has this written on the back:
"The reason we have
<a href="http://www.norm.org/">
NORM [National Organization of Restoring Men]</a> meetings 
is to help each other obtain the best results. This is the 
way <b><i>not</i></b> to stretch -- laterally. A lot of 
determination but lacking information."

<P>*The term "foreskin restoration" refers to the various
surgical and non-surgical procedures used to re-cover the
glans of the circumcised penis. Jim Bigelow explains on
pages 134-138 of the of the Second Edition of 
<a href="joyofunc.htm">
<I>The Joy of Uncircumcising!</I> (Hourglass Book
Publishing, 1995)</a>, the bible of the
foreskin restoration movement, what can and cannot
be expected from these procedures. 

<P>[I know of two disastrous results following long, painful,
expensive (one more than $10,000) attempts at <I>surgical</I>
foreskin reconstruction. I would urge anyone thinking about
undertaking <I>any</I> type of glans re-covering to read
Dr. Bigelow's book and to contact one of the many NORM support 
groups in the U.S. and other countries.]
