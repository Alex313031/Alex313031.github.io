     "The most significant restoration discussed in this book is not that of the foreskin but of
     CHOICE, a choice restored to those from whom that right was taken when they were too young to
     defend themselves. Therefore, this book is dedicated to those circumcised men who cannot still the
     voice of their own indignation ... especially those who have believed that there is no hope."
<P>
     "The definitive book on the subject." (R. Wayne Griffiths, Co-founder of NORM)

     "The bible of the movement." (D. Travers Scott, "New Drapes," Wilde) / "Foreskin
     Envy," Isthmus ("The weekly newspaper of Madison"), 12/2-8/94.

     "Explosive! This powerful and passionate book will change you mentally, emotionally,
     physically, sexually, and even politically. Years from now the publication of The Joy of
     Uncircumcising will be regarded as a landmark event for the American male. All circumcised men--get
     this book." (Ronald F. Goldman, PhD, Executive Director, Circumcision Resource Center)
<P>
     "... adds a new dimension to the argument against routine circumcision ... The evolution
     of elective circumcision from a method to control masturbation and other "immoral" sexual behaviors
     to an accepted, routine medical modality provides an interesting discussion ... The psychological
     and sexual benefits of restoring the foreskin are expounded." (The Journal of the American Medical
     Association)
<P>
     "... an important statement on a theme about which little is usually said, and on which
     most of us are ignorant. Urologists should read this book, which should make them consider
     alternatives ... before offering circumcision ... and take seriously the wishes of the troubled
     patient who asks to have his mutilation corrected." (British Journal of Urology)
<P>
     "Jim Bigelow provides a profound service for the general public, for patients, physicians,
     and hopefully, most of all, for future generations of infant boys. In this multi-faceted, well-rounded
     and clearly written book, he leaves no stone unturned ... provides abundant facts and information
     necessary to include circumcision in any discussion of child abuse." (The Journal of Orgonomy)
<P>
     "In reading this book, one is forced to examine his/her own feelings about circumcision ...
     challenges us to think about new issues such as men's rights and foreskin restoration." (Journal of
     Nurse-Midwifery)
<P>
     "Most plastic surgeons will be surprised and many will be distressed at the information and
     arguments presented in this book ... Particularly valuable are the insights on why some men feel
     so strongly about the desirability of the uncircumcised penis ... It is an excellent introduction to a
     subject too long absent in plastic surgical literature." (Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery)
