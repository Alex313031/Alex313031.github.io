<P>Thank you for your site. It is a clarion call to
sanity. Your illumination and pursuit of truth as well
as your despair at those who cause suffering is
humanity at its finest. No doubt your reward will be in
heaven.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An image comes to mind upon beholding this amazing work
you have done: Sydney Lumet's (1962) Long Day's Journey
Into Night, with Katherine Hepburn at her finest. There
is a horrifying scene, as she weaves in and out of
sanity -- in this darkest of O'Neill's plays -- because
of a morphine addiction started by a quack doctor after
pregnancy complications. She is seated with her family
and knows she is losing herself again. "I hate 
doctors," she screams and shatters a plate against the
table, her entire body trembling in physical and
psychological torment. It is one of the most chilling
moments of the film.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I often feel like Hepburn. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A few anecdotes -- yes just anecdotes, but I 
always feel what can honest personal stories and
epiphanies be but small building blocks towards a
larger truth, no? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When I was quite young I felt something was wrong, the
scars, the fact that I did not look like statues in
museums, etc., but I assume the mind protects itself
from following these strains too much, too soon. I do
recall, though, from a very early age wondering exactly
what the foreskin did. Did it get bigger along with the
penis? Did it move? Did it always cover the tip or go
back and forth? I recall thinking if it went back and
forth that could be a very good thing indeed, and why
on earth would anyone prevent that from happening? It
seemed to me, again, just one boy becoming familiar
with his body, that that of all places would be a part
of the body where no one should really want anything
taken away. That, though, was about the extent of my
thinking on the subject for some time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In my reshman year of college, my roommate from Nepal
comes charging back into the room from the showers very
alarmed at the naked fellow hallmates in the bathroom. 
I look at him askance and say not to worry Americans
are a bit liberal and do not mind revealing themselves
in the shower room. We are all guys anyway. No, he
assures me the nudity is not the  problem. The problem
is that someone has wounded several of them. At this 
point I am confused, get up from my desk and ask for
clarification. He had never before seen a circumcised
penis and was, rightly so, alarmed. At any event, I
explained we do these things over here for health
reasons I presume; this he could not understand and
moreover thought that any supposed "health reasons" or
risks would be worth risking. Next thing I knew we were
talking about anatomy. Both of us were perplexed so I
asked him if he would not mind showing me. And so for
the first time in my life I was shown how a working 
penis works. I then showed him my member and where the
scar is. Nothing really strange about it save that it
was a profound learning experience for us both. For me
it was profound in that I recall for the first time not
really feeling like a real man, and thinking how
strange it should be that I should be learning about a
body part God gave me at birth through someone from a
more civilized culture explaining to me in as
charitable a way as possible what I was missing. A
peculiar thought pattern for the start of college, but
what are we to do?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My BA finished, I have been working on a doctoral
degree overseas. Never would I allow myself to appear
in a locker room here for I know the looks of pity I
would get. When I attend functions like large dinner
parties, or am in chapel services, it does pain me more
than slightly to realize that none of the guys in the
stained glass windows covering centuries of saints or
doubtless anyone else in chapel or at dinner (unless 
there is another Yank visiting or some such
circumstance) has a body like mine. My best part was
taken away. I have at any rate gotten better at 
knowing that this is not my fault. That, yes, I have
been emasculated -- anyone  who does not think so is
more than a bit loopy, and even from a Jewish 
perspective has not read their Maimonides, who himself
in the Talmud explains circumcision as a humiliation
before God -- but it is not my fault and the only 
thing I can do as a sensible human being is express
indignation and regret. I am not Jewish and thus will
not speak on the religious covenant structures of 
others, past or present (which incidentally should have
nothing to do with hospitals or doctors but synagogues
anyway. Interesting thought question: How  would I feel
about the idea of going to a hospital to receive
Communion or seeing a doctor for any other sacramental
purpose? It is more than slightly strange, and in the
case of medical circumcision has the double offense not 
only of abusing and offending the human body, but also
making mockery of a religious practice; the 20th
century alas has featured more than its fair share of
those who make mockery of Jewish religious practice).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Regardless, my main issue is simply about my own body
and how I feel about what has been done to it. I was
raised Roman Catholic and my religion SUPPORTS my
views. I know not only that my Church, but St. Paul and
any medic in Europe as well as the United Nations,
etc., etc., are quite strong in their stance on the
subject, and rightly so. Circumcision is not to be
tolerated in hospitals; it should not have been done to
me. It is a violation. There is no debate. My parents
doubtless thought what they were doing was best, and
they clearly did not have information to make a sound
decision. I do not fault them, for they are fine
parents who would never intend to cause harm. I do,
however, fault the medical establishment in the U.S. for
its perpetuation of this madness. It is sick and
insidious. Anyone who does not think this way clearly
has not gotten out of the U.S. all that much, or even if
they do live in the U.S. has not thought too much about
the human body, be it their own or those of others. 
Try walking through a locker room in a school overseas 
and feeling like a circus freak; just the idea of it is
not a good thing for one's sanity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Again very personal and confessional, but if it helps
anyone I do not mind the embarrassment of talking about
it: I recently have had some medical problems develop
that would not be occurring if I had been left alone. 
A painful vascular clot has formed that will need to be
cauterized; problems can arise. I am sorry but no one
should be cauterizing penises, EVER. I lament the fact
that 24 years after the day I was born I shall
encounter another cauterizing pen in my genitalia. I
saw a doctor over here who looked with pity at me and
my scarred member, as well as the clotting forming. He 
said to hang on; wait on the surgery, for it might go
away. Almost four months along, no improvement. Well,
needless to say, I have not been a happy camper as they
say. The worst is that I saw one urologist at home in
the U.S. on holiday who told me it was all in my mind. 
As he examined me and I told him it hurt, he told me I
was being over-sensitive and not to worry. "At least
you can be thankful you were circumcised," he said with
a happy grin. "No worries about penile cancer." As soon
as he said that I thanked him and walked right out of
the office. Disgusted. (Interestingly enough, as I was
waiting in the examining room, there was a chart on the
wall, sponsored by some drug company working on
prostate cancer. It explained prostate exams and had
color drawings of the body. The poster said: "The Human
Male" and had images of "the human male," cut of course
-- as if that were how he naturally should be. Good
heavens!) I have been in touch with more sensible
people over here and have found out about a sympathetic
urologist back home in the U.S. who is good at fixing
problems, and would never as a doctor say a nice word 
about circumcision.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All I can say is this: thank you again for the site. 
It gives me tremendous joy to read the stories of other
people, to know that I am not alone, and not crazy. I
do not plan on having children in the foreseeable
future, but of  course if I did I would be VERY
protective of them and never let them alone with any
doctors in the U.S., not just in light of circumcision,
but also forced foreskin retraction or any other
destructive humiliations endured as part of
"examinations." I really mean this. There are moments
when I feel like Katherine Hepburn, upset and enraged
at doctors, and where they have left me. Now I know of
course there are hosts of good ones and I am sorry they
are  caught up in this, but I do know this: I am a 24
year old male who is blessed with coming from a stable
background and being given a fine education. I should
be happy as a clam, and I am save that I am ashamed of
my body and the scarring and missing piece, how I know
that I have been altered and am not fully in God's
image as I was made, but have been branded, that's the
word, branded by a crazed American medical aesthetic,
and I am, rightfully so, indignant and more than
slightly saddened. It is wrong. Something wonderful 
was taken from me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a secret joy, though. I do know this because
my parents raised me  with a strong faith, a wonderful
gift. I fervently believe that if we are good in this
life and do our best, in the next we find heaven and at
the end  of time we are re-united with our bodies free
from disease and afflictions done to them, and will
have them for all eternity, and there are no 
cauterising pens in heaven.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Could be the name of a good book of short stories: "No
cauterising pens in heaven," one of those medical
horror sorts of books for the beach. Alas, you know
what they say about truth being stranger than fiction.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thanks again. Do keep up the good work. I hope you
realize the amazing extent of therapy you are
providing. I can think of no better service than
helping parents make wise choices about the birth of
their children, and providing those who feel afflicted
with the awareness that it is not their fault.

<P>I'm a 25 year old woman, married to a circumcised man, which has
never really been an issue one way or the other, I might add. I've
never dated an intact man, as you call them. I've never even seen one
naked in person.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We're trying to get pregnant and if our children are all girls, no 
problem, end of
discussion.  But if we have boys?  I've never talked about circumcision
with my doctor.  Never thought twice about it.  Never really considered
what went on in a circumcision.  We're both Catholic, so there's no
religious reason for it, but I'd always heard these rumors that it
prevented disease, cancer, or that it simply looked better, cleaner,
etc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Your website showed up on a search I did this evening for information
about sexual abuse--I am working up a DFS case against a parent at my
school, and was looking for info.  I wasn't looking to spend an hour
scrolling down your page.  I wasn't thinking about circumcision at all,
even--I was looking for more standard definitions of sexual
assault/abuse.  But I clicked on your page and indeed spent the time,
checked out the links, read the articles, saw the pictures.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I had no clue.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm not the sort who believes everything she sees on the Internet.
So I'm not going to say right here this very moment, "I
will never ever circumcise my boys."  But I will say that I wound up at
your page for a reason, I believe, and that was to open my eyes to
something I had never given any thought to.  Now I have another thing
to think about as I carry our first child.  If it's a boy, what do we
do?  What does my doctor believe?  What are the statistics for my
hospital?  Do I get to give my consent--and there's the big question for
me.  If it's a "routine" and automatic procedure, then I'm not giving
birth there.  I need to be given the choice, after careful reading and
research, to say yes or no with full knowledge.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You've opened my eyes.  I've jotted down some of the book titles you
listed, and I plan (I've got the time) to spend some time looking
around, seeing what other sources tell me.  (But in my heart, I think I
know what my decision will be--I think I'm just looking for more
evidence than "I read on a website once...").

<P>Great site! (In a depressing and sobering kind of way)
I'm 18, UK, intact and staying that way! 


<P>Thank you for your informative and well-researched website. I have
just explored it at length and was duly shocked by most of what I
found. The photos of a circumcision in progress were so sickening
that I had to turn away from the computer - this from a woman proud
of her cast-iron stomach. As an ardent feminist, I had previously
dismissed most men's issues as secondary to my purpose - I wished
you guys all the best, but I had my sisters to think about. Not any
more - this is a human rights issue (not that I need to tell you,
obviously). When this letter is finished, I will being going to
<a href="http://www.nocirc.org">
www.nocirc.org</a> to see what I can do.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One request for clarification on the website - many times, male
circumcision is compared as identical to female circumcision. This
is not the case. While some forms of female circumcision are
equivalent to the removal of the foreskin, your readers need to know
that millions of girls are subjected to a far more drastic
procedure. The most severe form, infibulation, is basically the
removal of the entire external genitalia. If the same procedure were
performed on a male, it would be the complete amputation of the
penis.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This aside, your site was deeply moving. I had no idea so many
adult men had such strong feelings about the subject, although I know 
realize they are completely justified. At 16, I'm not yet
involved romantically with anyone (male or female), but after
reading about the consequences of circumcision on heterosexual
intercourse, I hope the men I fall in love with will be intact, and
I will help them celebrate this. Should I fall in love with a
circumcised man, I will try and encourage him to arm himself with
the facts, in order to help him heal.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In closing, just a few facts to show you that activists like you
<I>are</I> making progress. Although my father is circumcised, my 14
year-old brother is not, and should I ever have sons, I can
guarantee you and them 100% that there will be no cutting up of my
children.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Peace!

<P>Greetings from India. I had written to you earlier
while I was visiting USA in 1998 (Muslim living in
India circumcised at age 10 by a barber). I am happy
to note that you have included my comments in
the comments section of your excellent website.
Since my return to India I have been meaning to write
to you about my further observations.
I recently saw a movie which more or less conveys the
perspective of several Indian & Pakistani Muslim
children who become victims of circumcision and would
request you to see it. The name of the film is East Is
East. It is produced in part by BBC & deals with a
Pakistani Muslim settled in England in 1970s. There is
a part where the father who becomes aware that one of
his sons has escaped circumcision goes about getting
the problem fixed. The boy clearly emotes what
millions of children in the age group of 5-10 years
feel when faced with the prospect of Khatna 
(circumcision). The film is in English as well as Hindi.
I shall be writing again.

<P>I'm amazed at how the intact organ works. And reading
about the loss of sensation makes me angry. Looking at the
photos of the infants undergoing the "painless" operation
and reading the mothers' descriptions of the operation is
infuriating. The doctors who do this almost seem like
sadists, or make the Nazis look civilized. How could they
hear the crying and/or look at the child's expression and 
say there's no pain?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'll pass this information along to my son so that if he
has sons, he can prevent their mutilation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you for the service you are providing.

<P>I was circumcised.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was the worst thing anyone has ever done to me. The circumciser should 
have been killed before chopping off my foreskin. Circumcision should be 
outlawed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My first experience with intactness was one of my friends. We were playing 
"I'll show you mine, you show me yours." And I saw he was intact.
I then realized I was not whole, that I had been mutilated. I was jealous 
of intact men for several years before finding out about foreskin 
restoration. Now I have started the process myself, in secret.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I do not hate my parents for letting me be circumcised. I hate the medical 
establishment. My parents were uninformed, and they gave consent for the 
mutilation. Doctors who circumcise should have their medical licenses taken 
away, just like what happened to my foreskin.

<P>I have visited your website many times, usually for inspiration when
necessary. 
I became aware of and got involved in the circumcision issue in early 1998, 
just before my wife and I adopted our son. I had never given it much thought, 
and was amazed to learn that over 80% of the world's males are intact. 
Luckily, we learned enough to spare our son. But since I am mutilated,
the issue gradually drew me in with ever increasing gravity. It still
does. I just want to say "Thank You" for your wonderful site. It is a
continuing source of inspiration.  

<P>I have for about a year now lamented that my circumcision was wrong. Not 
only because I'm not a Jew, but for the following reasons:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1) It's NOT medically necessary. Should we remove everyone's appendix 
and tonsils in advance because they COULD cause trouble? NO! OF COURSE 
NOT! It's a waste of money and destroys part of the body that normally 
has a useful function. Nature intended it to be there.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2) It's devastating to pleasure in masturbation. With a butchered always 
dry tightly-skinned penis, I believe I will never know the pleasure that 
nature had in store for me. Masturbation will never be as it is for natural 
men, and I'll never known what it would have felt like to have natural skin 
and natural moisture in that area. I am resolved to only have artificial 
moisturizers to make masturbation feel at all comfortable or pleasurable.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3) My sexual partner(s) will never know the pleasures of hassel-free sex.  
Because I have to use artificial moisturizers ("lube"), I can't just go from 
erection to insertion into my partner. I have to stop and grab a bottle of 
lube to prepare something that didn't naturally always need preparation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4) A part of me is missing, something I was supposed to grow up with and be 
used to and for this I am desolate.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I curse the "doctor" who did this! I wish him 100,000 such "procedures" to 
be done to him over and over without pain medication, without anesthesia, 
and in the burning pits of retribution we call hell!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-A butchered adult male in search of what he can never have.

<P>Your site is a wealth of information for those of us fighting this
battle in the trenches. Thank you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the summer of 1998, a baby boy died at University Hospitals of 
Cleveland 
from circumcision-related complications. The story was posted on 
Channel 5's website (ABC affiliate in Cleveland) but a couple hours 
later was removed. I searched AltaVista to find it and found 
it on the 
<a href="http://www.noharmm.org/">www.noharmm.org</a> website. 
After I browsed it thoroughly and compared photographs to my penis, I 
determined that I was circumcised. No one had ever told me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I find it repulsive that such an activity occurs in a so-called 
civilized society. I hope to restore my foreskin either by stretching 
or surgery. I often wonder what intercourse and masturbation would feel like 
with a complete penis. Certainly they are nothing spectacular without one.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But this is part of the purpose, numb the sensation to make it less 
attractive for men, for we certainly can't trust them to make proper 
decisions on their own! This is precisely the same reason given to 
mutilate women in Arabia, yet that is seen as a horrific crime, while 
male mutilation is simply a "cultural decision." That my own friends and 
relatives fail to see the double standard in this is quite frustrating 
to me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By contacting you, I hope to join the online community fighting against 
circumcision. I am in the works of writing my own personal website on
my own personal web server. When it is finally running, I hope it will be 
a source of information for those who are living with the horror of mutilation.
