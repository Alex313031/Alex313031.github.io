<blockquote>
     After the years of shame, acting as an accomplice, I am proud to be here today as an R.N.
     conscientious objector to infant circumcision. I'm proud to be here today as a patient advocate for
     the babies. I'm proud to be here as a Jew, as a woman and feminist, and as a human rights
     activist. And most of all, I'm proud to be here as a human being with the courage to hear the
     screams of the babies and to follow my conscience.
<P>
          In our society, circumcision generally takes place in hospitals behind closed doors. That's
     why I've come today, to let parents know: Your babies are screaming behind closed doors. These
     are the instruments used to cut away part of your baby's sexuality: Circumstraint board, probe,
     Gomco clamp and blade.
<P>
          I have a message for parents: Circumcision isn't medically necessary, and in fact it is
     harmful. No, it isn't "cleaner" to cut off your baby's foreskin. Think about it. You wouldn't cut off
     your baby's ears or nose or rip out his fingernails to make him cleaner. You wouldn't cut off part of
     your baby girl's sexuality. Your babies, boys and girls, are beautiful, and their whole bodies are
     sacred.
<P>
          I have a message for other nurses across the country who shudder as they assist with
     circumcision: You don't have to do it anymore. You can join us as conscientious objectors.
<P>
          I have a message for the babies: We love you and we are here to protect you.
<P>
          I have a message for our African sisters who are working against genital mutilation in their
     own countries; bless you. We support you and join you in a world-wide movement against all forms
     of genital mutilation.
<P>
          I would like to close with a brief prayer of healing for the babies, especially for the ones
     who are being circumcised this very moment as we speak. Let us pray for the countless men, our
     brothers, who have been grievously harmed by this procedure. Let us pray for the parents who have
     given consent. Let us pray for the nurses who have assisted all these years. And, finally, I would
     like to say a brief prayer of healing for the circumcisers, mostly physicians, almost all circumcised
     men themselves, who continue to carry on this brutal tradition of infant genital mutilation. May we
     all find healing and forgiveness.
<P>
