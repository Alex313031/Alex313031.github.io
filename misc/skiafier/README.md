__Purpose:__ This program converts .svg icons to .icon format, used in the native UI of <a href="https://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a> based browsers. .icon is a vector format that passes instructions directly to <a href="https://skia.org/">Skia</a>. For more information, see > <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/components/vector_icons/README.md">Here</a>.
