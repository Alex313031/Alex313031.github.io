[man narrating] 
Circumcision is the most 
common surgery in America.

11
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,653
Whether or not you choose 
to learn about it,

12
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,155
it's there, 
directly impacting

13
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,526
the majority of American men 
in the most intimate 
way possible.

14
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,231
[Georganne Chapin] 
One of the things I found 
about this issue is that

15
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,533
nobody who thinks about it

16
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,901
will ever forget it.

17
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,404
They might not ever want 
talk about it,

18
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:49,542
they might spend time 
explaining that it's not 
an important issue,

19
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,544
but people will circle back.

20
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,914
[narrator] 
And yet, many Americans 
have never taken the time

21
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,518
to think deeply 
about circumcision.

22
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:02,188
Circumcision is the surgical 
removal of the foreskin,

23
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,657
the foremost part 
of the male penis.

24
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,894
And in America, it is typically 
performed on infants

25
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,163
within the first 
few days of life.

26
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,733
No other 
industrialized country

27
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:18,304
routinely practices nonreligious 
infant circumcision

28
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,406
other than America.

29
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:27,614
Isn't it odd that 
Americans have never had 
a national conversation

30
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,517
about one of the central 
practices of their culture,

31
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,419
a practice which affects so many

32
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,355
on such a personal level?

33
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,756
[people chattering]

34
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,292
One group is 
starting a conversation

35
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,394
about circumcision in America.

36
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,567
Intactivism is a social movement

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,969
of people who believe 
that all children

38
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,539
have a right 
to keep the genitals 
they were born with.

39
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,741
Cutting any part 
of their genitals off

40
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,476
is a violation of human rights.

41
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,411
And there are activists 
all over the world

42
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,812
that understand our message,

43
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,982
that boys and girls 
are born with a body

44
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,751
that is their right to keep.

45
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:09,455
They feel that that boy's right 
to decide for himself

46
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,991
is more important 
than the parents' right

47
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,593
to decide what's best for him.

48
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:17,497
It's a very powerful, 
compelling topic.

49
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,568
For one thing, if 
you've acquiesced to having 
your child circumcised,

50
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,405
and then you hear later 
that it might not have 
been the right thing,

51
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,674
that's a mortifying feeling.

52
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,410
It's a feeling either that 
overwhelms you with--

53
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,980
with embarrassment 
or grief or rage,

54
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,848
or it's one that 
you wanna dismiss,

55
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,051
but it's not a neutral thing.

56
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,919
It's never 
a neutral thing 
for a parent.

57
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,623
The five most sensitive 
parts of the penis

58
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,559
-are removed 
during surgery. 
-Wow.

59
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,894
I'll read up on that. 
I didn't know.

60
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,462
I just thought 
it was an incision.

61
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,030
I had no idea they 
actually removed tissue.

62
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,466
It's very harmful, 
because it's done to the baby 
without their permission.

63
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,301
[man] You guys know 
that it's hygienic,right?

64
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,536
-You do know that, right? 
-It's not.

65
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,571
-It's not? 
-[man 2] I mean, you think 
we just came here

66
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,573
and set up a demonstration 
without knowing what--

67
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,975
You know-- 
you know it is hygienic.

68
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,010
You know, women have 
foreskin as well, right?

69
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,545
They have a little foreskin in--

70
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,879
-That's totally different. 
-Why?

71
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,882
That's totally different. Why?

72
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,951
because they have 
sensitive nerve endings,

73
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,553
-and it's-- 
-And you don't?

74
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,822
[Georgeanne] 
If you're a circumcised man,

75
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,324
it's a potentially awful 
thing to think about.

76
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,561
"Okay, I was tied down 
when I was a baby

77
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,630
"and somebody cut 
part of my body off.

78
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,898
"That's not so great,

79
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,500
"but I don't remember it.

80
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,569
Maybe-- oh, you know 
what? I'm fine."

81
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,904
All of this stuff 
comes into play,

82
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:36,042
and I don't think 
you can just walk away 
from feelings like that.

83
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,111
I've been around 
a lot of social movements,

84
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,913
but the one's that unique about 
the Genital Integrity Movement

85
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,349
is that it's all tragedy 
through and through.

86
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,852
Something-- something 
horrible happened to all of 'em 
to bring 'em here.

87
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,922
Nobody-- nobody came here 
feeling good about circumcision

88
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,425
and then got involved. 
It's because something's 
happened to them

89
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,794
or something's happened 
to somebody that they 
care about...

90
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,563
that's ruined their life.

91
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,565
and I don't think that's 
too strong of a phrase either.

92
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,869
Circumcision fundamentally 
changes you forever.

93
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,446
I went through what's called 
the obsessive epiphany.

94
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,982
Everybody knows-- 
who's worked in this business 
knows the epiphany.

95
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,484
It's the moment when you go 
over the top on this issue,

96
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,920
and you realize that there's 
more here than meets the eye,

97
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,156
and that even though it's 
normative in your culture,

98
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,857
there's something 
strange about it.

99
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,026
So I started doing 
the late-night research, which--

100
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,862
virtually anybody 
that you interview on 
the subject will tell you

101
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,664
about the late-night research.

102
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,067
You just-- it becomes, it-- 
it takes over your life.

103
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,669
You're reading everything, 
and you're reading the footnotes

104
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,938
to the footnotes 
to the footnotes,

105
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,574
and going deeper and deeper, 
and getting more and more 
and more horrified

106
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,975
and more and more angry.

107
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,877
I mean, I can't even 
remember what I did,

108
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,913
but I'm sure I put 
"circumcision" in the 
Google window,

109
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,816
if Google even existed then, 
and just went from there.

110
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,518
And there's just massive 
literature on the subject.

111
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,755
A massive literature. 
You could spend a lifetime 
reading it all,

112
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,890
whether-- whether from 
a religious perspective,

113
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:01,527
anthropological, sociological, 
legal, medical, bioethical.

114
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,129
Name your field or discipline,

115
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,466
and it has something 
on the subject, so, I mean,

116
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:12,505
for the serious scholar, there's 
just endless opportunities 
there to horrify yourself,

117
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,575
amaze yourself, 
and wonder why this 
ever got started.

118
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,578
I went to my first 
Intactivist gathering,

119
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,080
They were some of the most 
interesting people I'd ever met.

120
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,916
[Dean Edell] 
We were having my fourth child 
in the hospital.

121
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,620
That night, we came 
across Marilyn Milos,

122
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,021
who was a nurse in the hospital.

123
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,224
I discovered that there 
were activists out there

124
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,726
in particular, Marilyn Milos.

125
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,729
Marilyn Milos, who we considered 
the mother of us all,

126
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,700
who started sounding the call 
30-odd years ago.

127
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,936
I went back to school to be 
certified as a nurse midwife.

128
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,806
My last rotation, 
May of 1979,

129
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,941
I witnessed a circumcision,

130
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,010
and that's when 
I realized the horror

131
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,945
of what we do to babies 
behind closed doors,

132
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,747
and I'd never heard a scream 
like that come out

133
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,582
of the mouth 
of a human being before.

134
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,684
I started to cry, and I was 
standing next to the baby

135
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,686
to comfort him. 
And the doctor saw me.

136
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,190
I just couldn't control myself, 
and I have projectile tears.

137
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:08,127
And he looked at me and said, 
"There's no medical reason 
for doing this."

138
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,564
So not only was 
I witnessing a torture 
and mutilation of a baby,

139
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,232
I was also hearing that 
it wasn't necessary.

140
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,235
And then of course the question 
is, "Why then are we doing it?"

141
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,838
As I began to inform parents, 
as I became informed

142
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,740
and informed the other nurses,

143
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,075
the head nurse came 
to me one day, and she said,

144
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,547
"There's somebody on the floor 
who's upsetting patients

145
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,817
by talking about circumcision." 
And I said, "Well, we're all 
doing the education.

146
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,052
Our jobs as nurses 
is to educate."

147
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,588
And they said, "Well, 
we can't have you upsetting 
the patients, Marilyn."

148
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,258
So in 1985 when I was 
fired, that's when we became 
a nonprofit organization.

149
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,129
We filed a lawsuit in 1982.

150
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,198
A little boy was circumcised, 
the mother didn't want it,

151
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,266
the father did. 
We went to the Superior Court,

152
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,236
and the judge then said, 
"Because circumcision is

153
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,072
"the oldest surgery 
known to man,

154
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:57,543
"and because of the court's 
reluctance to interfere 
with family life,

155
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,146
"we're going to just say 
that it's okay for the--

156
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,949
this is a decision 
that's up to the parents."

157
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,784
So nobody was ready to hear it,

158
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,820
but I think that that is 
how this sort of began

159
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,956
burgeoning forth 
into the media and so forth,

160
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,926
and the backlash 
with the Schoens 
and the AAP.

161
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:34,213
I got interested in 
circumcision in 1987

162
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,950
when I was asked by American 
Academy of Pediatrics

163
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:42,722
to chair the American 
Academy of Pediatrics 
Task Force on Circumcision.

164
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,324
The reason why they 
formed that task force

165
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:50,796
was because the American 
Academy of Pediatrics

166
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,901
actually put its foot 
in its mouth in 1971.

167
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,738
Somebody wrote 
a single sentence--

168
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,907
we don't even know 
who wrote it--

169
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,077
saying there are 
no valid medical indications 
for newborn circumcision.

170
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:08,814
The American Academy 
of Pediatrics came out firmly 
against circumcision

171
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,183
and said that it was 
unnecessary and there 
was no reason for it.

172
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,153
And there was 
a howl of complaint 
from their membership,

173
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:18,324
from having performed this 
surgery for so long and suddenly 
turning their back on it.

174
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,393
But that became 
the official policy

175
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,361
in the American 
Academy of Pediatrics,

176
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,132
no valid indication, 
and the anti-circs still

177
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,200
go back to that 
all the time.

178
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,705
So they have a vested interest 
in maintaining the procedure

179
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,207
and not angering 
the 70 million American men

180
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,643
who are circumcised 
and admitting nothing.

181
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,413
It completely was out 
of line, but what the function

182
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:44,050
of the committee was, 
to show that there 
are indications.

183
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,653
So, that was that, 
until my committee.

184
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,389
[Marilyn] And he went in 
with the same laundry 
list of excuses.

185
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,092
I know he finagled his way 
into that position.

186
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,861
One of the things i said 
before I took the job.

187
00:09:55,895 --> 00:10:00,099
I says, "I don't 
want this committee 
to be under the thumb

188
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:04,937
of a committee 
of the fetus and newborn, 
which put out the other one."

189
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,906
And another doctor who was 
on that committee at one point

190
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,908
threw his hands up in the air 
and said, "I'm outta here.

191
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,977
"This is-- this is undemocratic. 
You came in,

192
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,878
expecting to railroad 
a position through."

193
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,349
We had one neonatologist 
on the committee who was very...

194
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,385
committed to the old position.

195
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,355
And as a matter of fact, 
before we even had 
our first meeting,

196
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,390
he said, "I ain't gonna 
change my mind."

197
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,828
Evidence has just been 
accumulating in favor,

198
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,097
and every month, 
you look at it,

199
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,299
there was another article. 
I can't keep up with it.

200
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,302
There's one guy who keeps 
sending me new papers.

201
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:41,340
Brian, stop sending me 
another HPV paper.

202
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,875
So what I'm going 
to tell you today

203
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,944
is that male circumcision 
is better

204
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,113
for genital health, 
public health,

205
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,281
and individual well-being.

206
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,421
The reason I became 
passionate about it

207
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,823
is because I'm passionate 
about science

208
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,192
and evidenced-based medicine,

209
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,929
And I became aware 
that there are...

210
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,199
individuals in society 
who are anti-science

211
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,935
and in favor of, you know...

212
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,405
retaining the foreskins.

213
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,106
There's a whole list 
of risk factors

214
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,342
in life that people 
should become aware of:

215
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,179
They're not to smoke, 
not to drink to excess,

216
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:25,117
and another one is to insure 
that their infant children 
get circumcised.

217
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,788
I've had communications with 
the chair of the AAP committee,

218
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,856
so I have been involved

219
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,492
over the years as 
an international expert.

220
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,429
I am a person 
who likes to speak up.

221
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,932
It might be my Baptist 
upbringing. Who knows?

222
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,034
I'm not gonna preach religion,

223
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,103
but I've got this message 
about health.

224
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,871
And I'd be happy to preach it

225
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,840
in all its various 
shapes and forms,

226
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,277
and one of those aspects 
is circumcision.

227
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,815
Those who oppose 
circumcisions are 
causing needless deaths,

228
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,884
needless suffering of people 
in our community.

229
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,920
They should desist.

230
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,225
[man]: Do you really think 
there's deaths that are caused--

231
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,960
-Absolutely. 
-[man] Wow.

232
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,030
Deaths from HIV AIDS, 
deaths from penile cancer,

233
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,966
and many deaths 
from cervical cancer.

234
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,003
All preventable by circumcision.

235
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,384
In the parental decision-making,

236
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,188
there's beyond the medical-- 
there's the non-medical aspects,

237
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,825
whether you want to call 
that cultural, religious,

238
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,996
aesthetic, family tradition, 
personal experiences--

239
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,066
whatever it is, 
people may use the medical

240
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,468
as a justification,

241
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,104
but it really comes down 
to the end of the day,

242
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,473
Do parents really want it, 
or parents don't want it.

243
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:58,978
I think that the report tried 
to make an effort to bring 
that out into the open

244
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,381
and say that not only 
is that the case,

245
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:06,085
but that that's valid 
and that parents' wishes,

246
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,622
even for their 
non-medical considerations

247
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,424
are a valid part 
of their making this decision.

248
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,460
In my practice, 
I like to sort of define it

249
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,329
as... a tribal custom,

250
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,131
and if you belong 
to a tribe that does it,

251
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,633
then you really want it.

252
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,269
And you can define "tribe" 
however you want.

253
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,873
Now keep in mind, this is not 
a universally accepted standard.

254
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,343
This is roundly condemned 
by the Intactivists

255
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,513
who feel that 
the overriding ethical concern

256
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,016
is the right 
to bodily integrity,

257
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,019
and no one should be 
able to alter your body 
without your consent.

258
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:44,356
To me... that's actually 
the more interesting

259
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,560
controversy, or reason-- 
topic for discussion

260
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,529
And we have to 
decide as a society

261
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,965
"What are our 
ethical standards?"

262
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,507
If we go back far enough, 
what we find is that fathers

263
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,543
were circumcising their children

264
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,112
not ritually 
in the Jewish style,

265
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:12,518
but as a sacrifice 
to whatever deities they were 
sacrificing to at the time.

266
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:16,255
As a matter of fact, 
some scholars have given us 
pretty good evidence

267
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:20,559
that circumcision may have 
evolved as a substitute 
for child sacrifice.

268
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,229
"How did it become a Jewish 
ritual" is the question.

269
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:27,266
There you have to look 
at the "Bible," the "Torah," 
the "Five Books of Moses,"

270
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,368
in which the creator 
of the universe appears

271
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,104
to a 99-year-old man 
named Abraham,

272
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:37,676
tells him that he will 
be able to impregnate 
his elderly 90-year-old wife

273
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,513
and that their 
children will give rise 
to a tremendous nation.

274
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,717
"However," he says, 
"you must cut the flesh 
of your foreskin."

275
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,721
What happened at first was 
a fairly simple removal

276
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:52,391
of the front part 
of the foreskin 
and no more.

277
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:57,496
It was only later that 
that practice evolved further,

278
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,500
first because Jewish men 
during the Hellenistic period

279
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,503
wanted to perform 
an athletic contest naked,

280
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,640
and they didn't want 
to seem to be circumcised,

281
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,708
so they pulled 
the remaining 
foreskin back--

282
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,244
what's now called restoration--

283
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,214
they pulled the remaining 
foreskin back and clipped it, 
actually, in front.

284
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,449
so as to have 
a normal-looking penis again.

285
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,551
In order to stop them 
from doing that,

286
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,688
The Rabbis then instituted 
a second phase

287
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:26,058
they called periah, 
which meant removing 
the rest of the foreskin

288
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,494
and removing at a much more 
radical procedure.

289
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,462
It's important 
to understand that,

290
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,666
because the kind of circumcision 
that is performed

291
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:38,771
in Jewish ritual is 
essentially identical to what 
is done in the United States.

292
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:42,308
This very radical 
and very destructive 
kind of circumcision

293
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,377
in which practically all 
of the foreskin is removed.

294
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:53,085
Circumcision became the major 
symbol of difference

295
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,322
for Christians, 
between Judaism 
and Christianity.

296
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,290
This dates back 
to Paul's letters--

297
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,292
"Galatians," 
"Corinthians," 
and others--

298
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:04,396
he says specifically 
there that circumcision 
does not matter.

299
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,433
It was so amazing to me 
when I worked in a hospital,

300
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,503
and my first question would be, 
"I see-- I see that you're gonna 
have the baby circumcised,

301
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,373
and may I ask why you've chosen 
circumcision for your baby?"

302
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,308
and they would say, 
"Oh, because I'm a Christian."

303
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,311
And I said, "Do you know 
that there's 120 references

304
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,146
"to circumcision 
in the New Testament,

305
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,681
"that circumcision 
is of no value?

306
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,084
"If you're a Christian, 
you don't live by outward signs.

307
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,353
"you live by faith 
expressed through love.

308
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,155
"Christ shed the last-- 
was the last to shed the blood.

309
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,258
"He was the ultimate 
blood sacrifice for everybody.

310
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,228
We don't need to do this again." 
"Oh, I didn't know that."

311
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,630
People are not just Christians, 
they are Americans,

312
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,567
and circumcision is 
an American procedure.

313
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,137
They're practicing 
something because they 
consider they're this,

314
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,574
without ever really 
understanding what that means.

315
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,177
The next question 
that we come to is,

316
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:55,381
"How in the world 
did this get to become 
an American custom?"

317
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,150
In Victorian England 
in the late 19th century,

318
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,386
there was already 
well-embedded belief

319
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,822
that masturbation 
was a particularly 
dangerous business.

320
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,393
That loss of semen would 
weaken a child permanently,

321
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,695
might give him 
all kinds of sickness.

322
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:15,401
They said, "We can stop 
this very dangerous habit 
by performing circumcision."

323
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:19,238
[Marilyn] We know that 
circumcision began in England 
to prevent masturbation.

324
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,407
Masturbation was seen 
as this horrible thing

325
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,610
that could cause all kinds 
of diseases and insanity.

326
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,512
And that just took 
hold, you know?

327
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,781
We are a fairly prudish culture.

328
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,649
[Ronald] 
And it sounds crazy to us today,

329
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,618
but in those days, 
this was accepted.

330
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,354
[Geisheker] 
Doctors in the 1860s 
and 1870s claimed

331
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,357
that this would reduce 
the child's sexual sensation.

332
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,793
But then in the 1960s, it 
began to disappear as an idea.

333
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,595
Can you guess why? 
Because the sexual revolution

334
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,565
made having sexual 
pleasure permissible

335
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,867
for the first time, basically, 
in American culture.

336
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,337
And so all of a sudden 
the meme, the theme

337
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,407
that you were damaging 
your child sexually

338
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,176
was no longer good advertising.

339
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,311
So it just simply went plink! 
It just disappeared.

340
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,347
And now if 
you talk to physicians, 
they'll-- they'll claim utterly

341
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,716
that circumcision is 
not sexually damaging,

342
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,353
that it's sexually neutral, 
and that there's no harm in it.

343
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,557
And they forget entirely 
the medical history they have

344
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,494
in their own occupation 
that claimed exactly the 
opposite for over 100 years.

345
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,199
Currently, 
the benefit-to-risk ratio

346
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,601
of circumcision is 14:1.

347
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,870
That means there's 10 times 
the risk you're gonna get

348
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,872
a urinary tract infection 
as a baby,

349
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,308
that you'll have 
a lower risk of HIV,

350
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,343
less human papillomavirus.

351
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,446
So when you add all those up, 
there's 14 benefits,

352
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,248
some of them life-threatening.

353
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,419
These claims are irresponsible, 
and it's a scare tactic.

354
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,788
I don't think there's a lot 
of evidence for benefits,

355
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,756
and even if there 
were some benefits,

356
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,826
this is a radical-- 
a radical solution.

357
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,695
Major claims 
require major proof.

358
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,898
When you make a major claim, 
and it is indeed a major claim,

359
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,667
that we doctors 
can improve upon 
the human body

360
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,604
by removing organs, 
you've got to show 
me major proof.

361
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,806
Medical justification for this

362
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,908
is a very interesting 
subject in itself,

363
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,712
because it shifts 
over the decades 
from one topic to another.

364
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:11,583
Usually, it's the disease 
that is most of interest 
at the moment

365
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,853
that circumcision is claimed 
to be, quotes, "good for."

366
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,990
It began of course 
with cancer, the obvious.

367
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,926
Well, penile cancer 
is a rare disease 
of elderly men.

368
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,230
The likelihood any particular 
man ever getting it in his 
lifetime is very slim.

369
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,432
Those who do get it 
tend to be elderly

370
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:31,937
and often have 
very poor hygienic practices-- 
homeless men and so on.

371
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,274
Nonetheless, 
the claim became popular

372
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:39,645
that if we circumcise infants, 
we will be, quotes, 
"protecting them

373
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,547
from this terrible disease."

374
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,582
Then in the '60s, they said--

375
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,884
now we've come 
to the sexual revolution,

376
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,655
and they said, "Oh, 
circumcision will prevent 
sexually transmitted diseases."

377
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,757
Well, it didn't work. 
It has never worked.

378
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,293
We have a high rate 
of all of them in America,

379
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,895
as you know, where 
most men are circumcised, 
so that's ridiculous.

380
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:00,599
But just as soon 
as one claim disappears,

381
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,534
the next one appears.

382
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:06,438
For a while, it was 
urinary tract infections, UTI.

383
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,407
Well, girls get UTI's. 
What do we do for them?

384
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,543
We give 'em antibiotics. 
We don't chop off parts 
of their bodies.

385
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,879
Once again, this is 
an uncommon condition,

386
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,949
it occurs primarily in children 
who have other defects.

387
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,685
It occurs in girls 
more than in boys.

388
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,388
It is readily treatable 
by antibiotics within 
a day or two.

389
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,592
These are just the excuses, 
and every excuse--

390
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,062
when one excuse is debunked, 
the next one comes along.

391
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:33,465
It's almost like there's 
a disease of the decade.

392
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,073
[Geisheker] 
Name a decade and there was 
some fear at work.

393
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,976
Guess what the latest 
fear is these days.

394
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,410
HIV.

395
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,422
So, the only way 
to figure out whether,

396
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,492
in this case, male circumcision 
was gonna protect men,

397
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,394
was to do a randomized trial.

398
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,496
In this randomized trial

399
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,699
we identified HIV uninfected men

400
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:11,937
then we randomized 
them to either get 
circumcised immediately,

401
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,473
or delay circumcision 
for two years,

402
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:17,509
and found that 
the circumcised men

403
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,911
had 60% lower infection rates.

404
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,781
Those studies have really-- 
have really gotten legs.

405
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,350
I mean, they were picked up 
in the popular press.

406
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,086
[Friedman] Those studies are 
the reason why the American 
Academy of Pediatrics

407
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,089
released their 2012 
circumcision policy statement.

408
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,825
[Marilyn] 
It's the circumcision 
to prevent AIDS agenda,

409
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,093
with big, big bucks behind it.

410
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,728
If you're circumcised,

411
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,630
your chance of AIDS

412
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,966
is reduced by over 60%.

413
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,403
PEPFAR will provide $40 million

414
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:49,608
to support circumcisions 
for almost a half a million 
of boys and men!

415
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,977
All three of those studies 
have been contested

416
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,146
for their statistical shortcuts.

417
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,881
So, here's the results.

418
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,751
The number of men who were-- 
who were circumcised

419
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,953
who got infected after 12 months

420
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,790
was one and a half 
percent of the groups.

421
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,627
I've combined the stats to make 
it easy, but the studies were 
very similar.

422
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,396
The intact-- 
that is the men 
who are not circumcised--

423
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,665
their infection rate was higher,

424
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,834
3.38% of the group.

425
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,770
So the absolute risk reduction 
you could argue for

426
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,807
for circumcision is 1.8%.

427
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,776
And this is the stat you should 
be reading in your newspaper,

428
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,845
not the 53%,

429
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,114
because that's 
the relative risk reduction,

430
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,717
comparing the two little groups.

431
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,121
So, one of the commonest errors 
in statistics is for people 
to jack up their results

432
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,190
by talking about 
relative changes

433
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,125
and not talking 
about absolute changes.

434
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,929
With respect 
to the other behaviors, 
such as condom use,

435
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,465
men who consistently 
use condoms

436
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:49,835
had lower rates of HIV, 
The problem is with a...

437
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:54,139
behavior that requires 
long-term lifelong adherence,

438
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:59,177
you don't get 
the kind of... compliance 
that would be ideal.

439
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:03,982
So we were very much looking 
for other things that we could 
add into the prevention mix.

440
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:07,185
So, here we've got 
something that almost 
works like a vaccine.

441
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,655
They've said circumcision is 
like a highly effective vaccine.

442
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,526
Now, the measles vaccine, 
you've probably had that.

443
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,130
99% of the people who get 
the measles vaccine 
and its boosters

444
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,965
become permanently 
immune to measles.

445
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,167
That means you can have 
somebody with measles

446
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,736
sneeze on you, 
you know, cough on you,

447
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,038
do whatever 
and you won't get measles.

448
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,174
That is what an effective 
vaccine looks like.

449
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,943
Even if circumcision 
has some effective protection,

450
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,779
it's not like a vaccine.

451
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,882
If you have sex many times, 
you'll eventually get HIV.

452
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,185
It has already 
been noted in a couple 
of different African countries

453
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:44,055
that men are lining up 
to get circumcisions so they 
won't have to use condoms.

454
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,057
So, even if there's 
a protective effect,

455
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,093
I believe that will be 
completely swamped

456
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,962
by people not using condoms, 
which are much more effective.

457
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,199
Well, certainly that was 
a concern we all had.

458
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:58,036
It's what's known 
as a "risk compensation" 
in the jargon.

459
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:03,742
It means that if people 
believe that they're protected 
from a health risk,

460
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,579
they're going to increase 
their risk behaviors.

461
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,148
But we followed men in the trial

462
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:14,019
and we've now 
been following them 
for four years after the trial,

463
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:18,190
and we see no evidence 
that they increased their 
risk behaviors.

464
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,659
Researchers attempted

465
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,094
to dispel this claim 
and did a study,

466
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,530
showing that, "No, actually, 
the men who were circumcised are

467
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,934
-more likely to use condoms." 
-If anything, what we're finding

468
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:33,772
is that the men who choose not 
to come for circumcision

469
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,674
have a higher risk profile.

470
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:40,545
They tend to be the cowboys who 
don't take care of themselves

471
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,881
and then try to mitigate risk.

472
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:47,252
Well, if the men who 
were circumcised are more 
likely to use condoms--

473
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,222
go back to those 
original three studies--

474
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,858
isn't that what's 
preventing the HIV,

475
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,193
that they're more likely 
to use condoms, maybe?

476
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,935
[Geisheker] 
All right, let's go 
through the flaws.

477
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,804
Flaw Five: Selection Bias.

478
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,573
Only men interested in male 
circumcision were included,

479
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,810
and so that possibly-- that 
automatically excludes others

480
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,179
who might've 
been at lower risk 
because of behavior.

481
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:16,081
Number six: 
They were well-paid.

482
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,583
mostly were unemployed. 
Frankly, the young men 
were desperate,

483
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:22,687
and this way 
they would get cash, 
they'd get a free circumcision,

484
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,123
and they'd get 
free health care 
for a year or two.

485
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,959
which in the US would be 
like giving you $12,000.

486
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:32,030
So that-- 
just the very structure 
of these studies

487
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,699
makes them unethical in the US.

488
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,801
The next problem is that 
for every participant infected,

489
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:39,070
a huge number were lost.

490
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:43,308
I mean, at the highest, 
7.4 for every individual 
that was involved was lost.

491
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:47,245
You have to wonder what 
would've happened had those 
people stayed in the study.

492
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,115
Small differentials 
in the loss group could 
negate these findings too.

493
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,984
And all of these flaws 
are cumulative.

494
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,353
You know, the more flaws 
you have in the study,

495
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,188
the more the results 
of the study--

496
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,024
especially when they're small-- 
are called into question.

497
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,927
Flaw 13-- are you getting 
saturated on flaws here?

498
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,129
Have I convinced you? [laughs]

499
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,964
It's worth noting 
in relation to this,

500
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,266
continental Europeans have 
never practiced circumcision

501
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,168
to any significant degree,

502
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,405
and yet their health statistics, 
including their HIV statistics

503
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,774
are usually much 
better than ours.

504
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:19,010
We have the highest 
rates of HIV among any 
industrialized country.

505
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,179
How can anybody sane 
think that the country

506
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,982
with the highest circumcision 
rate and the highest HIV rate

507
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,985
is gonna stop HIV 
by circumcision? It's lunacy!

508
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,254
We predicted that 
eventually after a few years,

509
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:32,090
they were gonna try 
to translate these studies over 
and make them applicable

510
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,292
in North America, and sure 
enough, that's what they did.

511
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,995
I think it definitely has 
implications in America,

512
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:41,967
so it really is a shame 
that the rates of the procedure 
have really declined

513
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,868
in newborns in this country.

514
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,037
To do something like that, 
to advance your own career

515
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,841
on the backs of babies, that 
is evil. I consider that evil.

516
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:52,844
They've gone from voluntary 
circumcisions for men

517
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,847
to semi-voluntary circumcision 
for young men

518
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,884
to involuntary circumcision 
for infants, which is plan C

519
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,853
and was, I think, 
the plan all along.

520
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,722
Leaving aside 
the human rights issues,

521
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,758
there was a study that found, 
to their surprise,

522
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:11,396
that female genital cutting 
might possibly help in the 
fight against HIV.

523
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,832
Well, surprisingly-- 
and I'm being sarcastic here--

524
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:18,103
surprisingly, no one is 
proposing female circumcision 
be done to stop HIV.

525
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,339
Well, no one should be proposing 
that male circumcision be done 
for that reason either.

526
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,742
Here are the contra-studies...

527
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:27,112
including three by the authors 
of the African RCTs.

528
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:31,883
Studies, in other words, 
that show that the effect is 
not as good as you would hope.

529
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:36,054
So, I don't really 
have any regard at all 
for the HIV claims.

530
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:40,992
I find them distracting 
and spurious

531
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,763
and... a waste of time.

532
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:51,202
People just think of the 
foreskin as something that may 
or may not become diseased,

533
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,738
and they think "Well, what 
are the health benefits,

534
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,340
what are the risks 
of this or that?"

535
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,809
They don't seem to factor in

536
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,778
the lifetime of pleasure.

537
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:03,181
I really love my foreskin, 
like, I genuinely do.

538
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,250
This has nothing 
to do with politics...

539
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,318
[laughs] 
or Intactivism, really.

540
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,120
I genuinely love my foreskin.

541
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,022
I show people why that is.

542
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,857
-Okay! 
-[crowd applauds]

543
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,794
So, I teach a seminar 
where I actually instruct

544
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:20,198
intact men on how to have 
orgasms with different areas 
of their foreskins.

545
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:23,301
I'm a professional 
foreskin demonstrator, folks.

546
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,104
I'm gonna show you 
a couple of clips that 
I use in my seminar.

547
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:29,007
The title of my show is 
"The Revolution Will Not 
Be Circumcised,"

548
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,044
where I basically 
give people a tour 
of the inner foreskin area

549
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:37,315
and show several different 
orgasms that can be achieved

550
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:41,319
by... exclusively 
stimulating these areas.

551
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:46,157
So, we're gonna start our trip 
through the foreskin anatomy 
with the frenulum.

552
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:49,527
Hands up, anyone who's never 
heard of the frenulum before.

553
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,362
Well, we've got 
a few of you. Exactly.

554
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,965
This is a really, really fun 
part of the penis.

555
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,835
Some people call it 
the male clitoris, because 
many men can orgasm

556
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,070
from exclusively 
stimulating the frenulum,

557
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,940
and I certainly can 
just by licking the tip 
of my finger

558
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:06,211
and just tickling-- 
just tickling very, 
very, very lightly,

559
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,913
I can orgasm. 
I have a video clip.

560
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:12,450
What I'm doing up here is 
very, very lightly stimulating 
my frenulum with my fingertip.

561
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:16,554
I'm not pushing hard at all. 
It's just a very light-- 
very light touch,

562
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,990
just on this one spot 
of my frenulum.

563
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:22,861
I really am getting 
the orgasm exclusively 
from this part of the penis.

564
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,163
There's no jerking of the shaft

565
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:28,133
or any-- or any touching 
of the head of the penis--

566
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:32,170
these are the areas-- 
the traditional sort of ways 
to achieve orgasm.

567
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,005
So factor those 
out of the equation

568
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,975
and show people that there 
are specific parts of the penis

569
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,878
that, in isolation, can give 
you very powerful orgasms.

570
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,579
And in my case, 
even multiple orgasms.

571
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,048
I'm a multiply-orgasmic male,

572
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,519
and I get my multiple orgasms 
from parts of my penis

573
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,188
that I would not have 
if I were circumcised.

574
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,423
I'm gonna show you a video

575
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,994
where I have five orgasms 
with ejaculations in less 
than two minutes.

576
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:59,631
just from touching this 
one spot on my penis,

577
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,499
the ridged band.

578
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,601
You might've heard that men 
don't have multiple orgasms,

579
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,904
Well, no, some of them do,

580
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,006
especially those that 
haven't had a large part 
of their penis cut off.

581
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,643
The pleasure potential of the 
foreskin area is spectacular.

582
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,511
I can prove it...

583
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,347
in a way that 
I think any reasonable 
person can see.

584
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,551
A claim like that is 
just in the imagination.

585
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,386
I'm sure he believes it,

586
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,289
but it's not supported 
by any form of evidence.

587
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,024
I was one of four physicians

588
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:30,094
that performed a touch-sensitive 
test on volunteer males.

589
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,096
[Marilyn] 
We did a sensitivity study 
that can determine

590
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,332
how responsive 
certain body parts are

591
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,434
by using these monofilaments.

592
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:39,904
The monofilaments 
are calibrated to bend 
at a certain pressure,

593
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:44,375
so you know your results 
are absolutely accurate, 
and they're repeatable.

594
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:49,147
[Mark] 
And we proved that the most 
sensitive part of the male penis

595
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,649
was the foreskin, and in men 
who had been circumcised,

596
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,653
the most sensitive 
part was at the site 
of the circumcision scar.

597
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,389
This was published in the 
"British Journal of Urology."

598
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,092
The lead author's name 
was Sorrells, Morris Sorrells.

599
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:06,264
The Sorrells study 
showed a 75% loss 
of fine-touch sensation

600
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,967
in a circumcised male 
compared with the intact male.

601
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,135
And the findings 
of our study showed

602
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,472
the most sensitive part 
of the penis is ablated 
with circumcision. Duh.

603
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,408
The foreskin, the frenulum, 
and the frenular delta

604
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,544
are the most sensitive part 
of the male penis.

605
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,450
Oh, there have been a lot 
of studies on sensitivity,

606
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,719
that goes back 
to Masters and Johnson,

607
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,420
way back in the '60s.

608
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,257
So, sensitivity-- 
the great major--

609
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,360
I don't know of any 
studies that showed 
any significant difference.

610
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,595
There are plenty 
of studies that claim otherwise,

611
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:40,031
that claim that 
men who are intact

612
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,001
and men who are circumcised 
have the same sexual sensation,

613
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:47,105
but every one of those other 
studies including the famous 
one, Masters and Johnson,

614
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:50,141
tested only the glans, 
the little fireman's hat

615
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,278
at the end 
of the man's penis, 
for its sensitivity.

616
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,513
And actually, 
the glans has very little 
in the way of sensitivity.

617
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,149
It was amazing to me 
that these researchers 
wouldn't understand that,

618
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:01,085
when the question 
came up, "Why didn't 
you test the foreskin?"

619
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,988
"Well, it wouldn't have 
been fair, because the other 
guys didn't have one."

620
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:08,259
Wait a second. If you're testing 
sensitivity, isn't that what 
you're trying to find out?

621
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:12,664
The minute you test 
the foreskin with its 20,000 
to 100,000 nerve endings,

622
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,300
you know that it's 
gonna be more sensitive.

623
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:19,504
It's actually the foreskin 
that is the male's main 
erogenous zone,

624
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,273
and foreshortening it 
or getting rid of it

625
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,776
definitely affects 
the male's sexual sensation.

626
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,744
If you ask a man-- 
a circumcised man--

627
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,047
where the most sensitive 
part of his penis is--

628
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,649
the absolutely most 
exquisitely sensitive part--

629
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:36,721
it is where the frenulum-- 
or frenum, both names-- 
was attached.

630
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,691
The little vertical thing that 
comes down from the opening.

631
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,193
Well, that's where 
the foreskin was removed.

632
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:45,463
That's a hint for men 
about what they've lost.

633
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,533
Now, the reason 
why the frenulum 
is capable of orgasm

634
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:53,271
is that it has thousands 
and thousands of these nerves 
called Meissner's corpuscles.

635
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,406
These are fine-touch nerves.

636
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,743
If you take your fingers 
and run them over the back 
of your hand...

637
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,679
You can feel it, but it's 
not terribly pleasurable.

638
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,414
You can feel 
the sense of touch.

639
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,317
However if you stroke 
your palm of your hand,

640
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,618
it kind of tickles a little bit,

641
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,687
and it feels 
a little bit better...

642
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,590
because there's 
a high concentration 
of Meissner's corpuscles there.

643
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,492
These are fine-touch nerves,

644
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,794
so what's interesting about them 
is the lighter you touch them,

645
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,230
the more sensation 
you get from them.

646
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,566
If you just run your fingers 
firmly over your hand, 
you won't feel much.

647
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,369
But if you go very lightly, 
you'll actually feel 
that tickle.

648
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,671
That's the Meissner's 
corpuscles.

649
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:31,476
They're touch receptors, 
which don't have anything 
to do with sexual sensation.

650
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,512
They just touch. 
If the foreskin is removed,

651
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:37,382
there's still plenty 
of Meissner's corpuscles

652
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,218
in the rest of the penis. 
It's not important.

653
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,619
But it's not just 
about sensation.

654
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,688
The foreskin...

655
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:48,826
allows the penis to glide 
in and out of itself

656
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:54,632
in a way that minimizes 
friction, so it decreases 
drying during intercourse,

657
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:58,736
and it decreases friction 
for both the man 
and his partner.

658
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:03,641
So, by removing 
this part of the penis...

659
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:08,746
we have rendered 
a structure that was meant 
to have moving parts...

660
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:14,252
to being just a... 
static structure.

661
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,387
[Marilyn] 
For an intact male, 
all those nerve endings

662
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,689
are stimulated as they 
cross over the glans.

663
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:22,760
and then the foreskin is 
everting, as with withdrawal, 
the same thing happens.

664
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:26,330
For a circumcised male, 
without having the foreskin,

665
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,633
he needs those long strokes.

666
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,235
An intact man just 
needs small strokes.

667
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,305
He's stimulating himself, 
he's being stimulated 
by the female,

668
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,607
and the two work together.

669
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:40,211
The long strokes 
take a man's body away 
from the woman's body,

670
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,146
so she too is struggling.

671
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:46,384
When we have alter-- 
altered our genitals,

672
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,687
we have to alter the mechanics 
of sex to compensate.

673
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,767
When you look at feminism 
in the 20th century,

674
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,603
one of the big arguments 
that feminists were making

675
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:09,674
was that women 
were not enjoying sex 
as much as they should,

676
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,943
because they are not educated 
about their bodies.

677
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:15,446
They wouldn't know 
about lots of the areas 
that they can go for pleasure.

678
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,715
There's the clitoris, 
the clit hood,

679
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,284
there's the frenulum, 
there's the inner 
and outer labia.

680
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,420
there's the pelvic floor, 
the G-spot.

681
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,555
There's all sorts 
of places women can 
actually get orgasms from,

682
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,658
separate, you know, different... 
sensations, different orgasms.

683
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:32,563
And the reality is 
is that men are actually further 
behind women in this regard.

684
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,398
Most men have no idea

685
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,902
of what the pleasure potential 
of their genitals is.

686
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,438
They just think it's this 
thing that goes in and out.

687
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,307
It's all very straightforward. 
It's actually not true. 
There's a lot more to it.

688
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,310
Here's another 
way of looking at it. 
This usually stops people.

689
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,814
I met an East African 
doctor once who told me, 
"If you circumcise women,

690
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,350
"they don't get 
bladder infections, 
they don't get STDs,

691
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,786
it's a lot cleaner." 
You hear all the same 
arguments all over again.

692
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,624
I liken this to female 
circumcision, which everybody 
feels clear about.

693
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,527
[Ryan] 
We get very angry when we think 
about female genital cutting,

694
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,928
and we want to use 
very different words.

695
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,564
Removing the foreskin is 
a public health measure,

696
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:10,635
which has multiple benefits, 
and comparing...

697
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:17,508
female-- they shouldn't use 
the term "female circumcision"

698
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,510
or male genital mutilation.

699
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,314
When my mother took me, 
we we walking into this home,

700
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,884
this long and dark hallway, 
it was the strangest 
feeling I had.

701
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,688
It's like I felt chills 
all over my body, 
I felt cold...

702
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:35,326
and I-- I knew something bad 
was going to happen.

703
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,695
And when I asked my mother 
where she was taking me,

704
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:41,399
She said, 
"I'm getting you a gift. 
It's time to become a woman."

705
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,535
And then I saw 
a young girl who was...

706
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,771
being taken out 
of one of the rooms--

707
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,806
maybe she was seven, 
I'm not sure--

708
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,809
who couldn't even cry 
because her voice 
was stuck inside,

709
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:58,883
And thus I knew-- 
I just knew that I'm going 
to be one of those girls.

710
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,451
In Europe, I was like...

711
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,454
"Never happen to this, 
all these women? No."

712
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,357
So, I started investigating 
and realizing

713
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,527
that we have to speak 
against it, so I felt like...

714
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,830
I have to use 
my own private pain,

715
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:15,333
my own wound 
to heal others.

716
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,602
Marilyn and I became friends, 
and she said, "You should 
come to my house."

717
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:21,606
So I came here to her house 
and she showed me a video,

718
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:25,309
young boy who was having 
the circumcision done.

719
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,011
She didn't say anything, 
she just put that tape on.

720
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,680
[baby crying]

721
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,686
Same thing I saw myself,

722
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,857
the way they tied 
the wrists and legs, 
tiny, on his-- that table.

723
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,760
-And the cry... 
-[crying]

724
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,663
I was like-- I was dead 
already when I was walking

725
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,698
to that hallway, 
laying down on that table.

726
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,434
That pain. I was-- 
it was me crying.

727
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,336
And then when I saw 
what he was doing,

728
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:56,073
the doctor, how he was pushing 
things up, cutting the foreskin,

729
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,576
I just couldn't-- I was-- 
I lost it. I just was like,

730
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,344
"This is-- this is mutilation."

731
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,914
How come in America, 
we keep fighting about

732
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,018
the rights of girls, 
and we're not saying 
anything about this?

733
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,353
I don't like anyone 
hurting a child,

734
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,023
so I'm against 
both male and female--

735
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,359
I am a human rights 
worker and activist,

736
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,728
that means 
all rights of children.

737
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:21,599
I cannot select one side 
and say, "I don't 
hear your cry."

738
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,937
I ask people how do they know 
that female genital cutting

739
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,541
is so awful 
and male genital 
cutting is so fine.

740
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,811
And they don't have any answer.

741
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,680
It's not like they've 
actually gone and talked

742
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,748
to someone who had 
experienced female 
genital cutting.

743
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,519
They just, in their gut, feel 
that female genital cutting

744
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,789
is terrible and male 
genital cutting is fine.

745
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:49,026
And I propose that 
that is due to our 
socialization around gender,

746
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,030
that we actually think 
male bodies are more expendable 
and more harmable,

747
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,133
and female bodies are more 
to be nurtured and protected.

748
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,071
And it has to do 
with our imperialism 
and our racism.

749
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:04,775
So we are very willing 
to point fingers at people 
of other ethnicities,

750
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:08,813
of other countries of origin, 
and other cultural practices,

751
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,615
and not as willing to look 
at ourselves really carefully.

752
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:16,587
It's okay to talk 
about African culture, 
barbarism, and mutilation,

753
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,122
but this is America.

754
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,825
We can't talk about, 
you know...

755
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,495
hurting all the young boys.

756
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:28,699
For me, it's not an issue 
of competitive suffering.

757
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:32,203
Everybody's hurt. 
It's the first cut.

758
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,872
After that, 
it just gets worse.

759
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,675
But it's the first cut-- 
of my cutting into your body--

760
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,043
that is the human 
rights violation.

761
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,579
The torture for me is the same.

762
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,848
That first cut 
is the same thing.

763
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,117
When they cut the child, 
they cut forever.

764
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,152
Her mind, same thing 
with the boys.

765
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,154
Where is 
a human rights violation?

766
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,456
Do you have to cut off 
this much of my finger 
or this much

767
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,959
or is it my whole hand 
that makes it a human 
rights violation?

768
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,027
No, it's the first cut. 
When ...

769
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,699
My freedom ends 
where your body begins.

770
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,136
It's as simple as that.

771
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,805
Everything that America does-- 
even if some people hate it,

772
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,573
they will do what America does.

773
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,942
So I said if we pass laws 
in this country

774
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,779
and say, "Hurting young girls 
this way is an abuse,"

775
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,247
then the Africans 
will think about,

776
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,582
"Oh my God, yeah. 
I should stop this."

777
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,485
I went to every 
politician I could.

778
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,755
I would speak everywhere, 
and in '96 we passed it.

779
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,190
it took nine years.

780
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,767
Now the AAP got in a little 
bit of trouble with this.

781
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,837
The American 
Academy of Pediatrics...

782
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,606
actually said

783
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,277
because we do drastic 
revisions on boys' genitals,

784
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,781
and that's considered okay, 
then we should be able to do

785
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,617
a little piercing 
of a girl's clitoris.

786
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,821
The AAP published 
this paper that said

787
00:40:56,854 --> 00:41:01,892
female genital cutting 
was far less invasive 
than male circumcision,

788
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:05,196
and that people from cultures 
that cut their girls

789
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,866
would be tempted to go 
back to their native countries 
to have their girls

790
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,235
genitally cut, 
so it would be better

791
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:15,773
if pediatricians could 
just carry out a ritual nick

792
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,208
on little girls' genitals.

793
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,710
So it's a minor...

794
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:24,215
and it's not-- 
it's not gonna have any 
long-term... harmful effects.

795
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,084
So they were 
actually advocating...

796
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:31,088
that it's okay to do some...

797
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,591
messing with little 
girls' genitals,

798
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,893
to take her to the doctor, 
pull down her pants,

799
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:40,097
spread open her labia 
and cut part of her clitoris,

800
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,132
or nick it, or do whatever.

801
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:46,704
I mean, no. That's disgusting. 
The thought of it is disgusting,

802
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,739
and everybody ought 
to be outraged--

803
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,808
well, everybody 
ought to be outraged 
about male circumcision--

804
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:55,246
but just the thought 
that we could lose that 
ground that we have,

805
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:59,617
that understanding about 
what t means to have autonomy

806
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,985
over your own body

807
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:05,623
because we have 
this horrible... situation

808
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:09,159
that everyone's ignoring, 
and so in order to 
have integrity,

809
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:13,130
you can just... 
say it's okay to 
do it to girls

810
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,599
or you have to say 
it's not okay either way.

811
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,969
And so to see 
that actual potential

812
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,372
manifest itself 
was frightening.

813
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:25,075
[Georganne] 
There's a federal law against 
any cutting on girls' genitals,

814
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:28,212
so this new policy by the AAP 
really suggested either that

815
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,715
doctors violate federal law 
or the federal law be changed.

816
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,084
I mean, the thing 
I had with the AAP

817
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:37,688
about having-- 
reversing a law 
we passed in '96--

818
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,292
oh, I was mad like hell, 
and I told them, I shamed them,

819
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,060
and they had to take it back.

820
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:47,031
It was a reasonable suggestion, 
but the... academy--

821
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,267
American Academy of Pediatrics 
then backtracked,

822
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,370
so we're back 
to the way it used to be

823
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,307
of total disapproval 
by the medical profession.

824
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,643
That really brought home 
the detriment

825
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,246
of male circumcision 
to me, because...

826
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:06,250
unless you draw the line 
and have integrity 
along that line,

827
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,419
it's-- it's not solid.

828
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:12,656
It's-- there's a danger 
of people doing some 
really horrible things

829
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,125
and using male circumcision 
as a justification.

830
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,129
[Fuambai Sia Ahmadu] 
If you're going to make 
the argument

831
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:22,833
that female circumcision 
is primarily conducted 
on young girls

832
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,169
who are not able 
to give consent,

833
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:26,837
well, what about boys?

834
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,672
They don't give consent.

835
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:32,109
My mother, aunt, and grandmother

836
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,345
approached me-- 
I was already in college--

837
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:38,282
and told me that they were going 
to take us back to Sierra Leone.

838
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,684
But I didn't know anything 
at the time about circumcision.

839
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:44,955
It was excruciating. 
It was very, very, 
very painful.

840
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:47,825
And for somebody like me,

841
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:50,294
you know, being mainly 
brought up in the US,

842
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,063
this-- I just had 
never experienced 
anything like that.

843
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,399
This is why I say 
that I do understand

844
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,735
some of the venom. 
[laughs]

845
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,803
[mumbles] 
Anti-FGM activists.

846
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,406
'Cause of course 
I go back to that moment, 
and I know how I felt.

847
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:05,876
After a couple of days, 
the pain started to subside.

848
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,980
And then it was more 
of the psychological, 
"What have they done?"

849
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,949
[laughs] You know?

850
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,151
I had no idea 
what I looked like.

851
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,987
"Am I going to have-- 
enjoy sex again?"

852
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:20,424
That was the test for me. 
"Am I going to...

853
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:23,827
just even have the same desire?" 
Of course, that didn't change.

854
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,730
And then, you know, 
the same feeling,

855
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,833
the same "When my man 
goes down on me"--

856
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:34,772
I mean, it just-- 
there was no difference, 
so it didn't affect me at all.

857
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,381
I think for a lot 
of women as well,

858
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,184
the external clitoris 
is extremely--

859
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:50,821
I know in my case 
it is extremely, 
extremely sensitive,

860
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,123
almost too sensitive, 
and that's how I was.

861
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,025
It was just too, 
too, too sensitive.

862
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,795
I'd never had an orgasm 
with oral sex prior to--

863
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,863
I have orgasms with oral sex.

864
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:03,867
Much of what I'm 
saying is not a surprise 
to researchers in the field,

865
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,870
because they're there, 
they know, they talk to women.

866
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:13,177
Physicians-- the bulk 
of evidence supports

867
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:18,882
my experience, but you 
wouldn't know that from just 
reading the activist literature.

868
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:22,886
because they say off the bat, 
"Oh, this is something done 
to diminish women's pleasure."

869
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,155
It's intended to be damaging.

870
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:28,392
It has to do with preventing 
a girl from having--

871
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:31,428
having pleasurable sex 
before marriage.

872
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,230
I was in Gambia for five years,

873
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,433
and a major emphasis 
of my field work

874
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,470
was on sexuality. 
I wanted to know,

875
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,171
"Am I unique? 
Am I different?"

876
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,240
You know, when I tried 
to explain it to them,

877
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,476
that, "Oh, western 
women say that this is 
the part that makes a"--

878
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,344
they just laugh. 
I have all this data

879
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,880
that contradicts 
what is being put out there,

880
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,416
and anti-FGM activists 
are absolutely not interested

881
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,152
in data or evidence at all.

882
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:59,389
I realize it's 
a very unpopular... position, 
and I've certainly paid,

883
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,593
paid, paid, paid, paid my price.

884
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:05,362
I view myself as being 
a kind of cultural ambassador

885
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,899
to explain this 
particular practice 
from the point of view

886
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,969
of supporters. 
Most of the women 
who engage in this,

887
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:15,005
who practice this think, 
"There's nothing wrong 
with what we do.

888
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,374
"This is-- it's been 
handed down to us. 
We're proud of it,

889
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,243
"We're honored by it. 
We're better for it.

890
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,978
"We're cleaner. 
We're more hygienic.

891
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:24,915
We-- we enjoy sex better." 
This is what they say.

892
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:29,219
Why should we change? 
It's like with the vast majority 
of circumcised men.

893
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,589
try convincing them they're-- 
they've done harm,

894
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,459
or they're mutilated, 
or, you know--

895
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:38,095
they wouldn't-- 
they would reject 
that completely.

896
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:42,866
There have been a lot 
of studies on circumcision.

897
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,037
Quite a few of them 
have studied the pain.

898
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,139
Until the mid-'80s...

899
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,543
medical doctors 
genuinely believed

900
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,412
that newborn infants 
did not feel pain.

901
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:58,315
They were actually doing 
abdominal surgery on infants

902
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:01,051
as old as 15 months 
without anesthesia.

903
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:04,555
Then what happened was 
some parents learned about this 
and complained about it.

904
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:07,424
A woman on the East Coast 
had a baby who had

905
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,526
open-heart surgery 
without an anesthetic.

906
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,062
The mother got in touch 
with Anand and Hickey,

907
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:13,397
and Anand then did this work.

908
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,098
The idea was 
"Do babies feel pain,

909
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,234
and could they document 
whether they did or not?"

910
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:20,470
Of course they did, 
and it turned out that 
the younger the baby,

911
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,140
the more exquisitely 
the pain is felt.

912
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,443
When that result 
was published in 1987,

913
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:30,380
it was concluded that yes, 
newborn infants can feel pain.

914
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:33,550
I mean, what's 
amazing about this-- 
again, the baby is crying.

915
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:39,356
but medical doctors 
are not sensitive to 
non-verbal responses to pain.

916
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,625
[Marilyn] 
It took the American 
Academy of Pediatrics years

917
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:44,194
for them to acknowledge 
the pain in babies.

918
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,263
About 50% of boys 
are being anesthetized.

919
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,098
That's-- that was 
the latest figure I heard.

920
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:51,101
Previously, we thought 
babies don't feel pain,

921
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,703
we don't have 
to use local ane--

922
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:56,206
they scream, 
but they scream 
if they're wet,

923
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,508
if they're-- if they're hungry, 
and so on like that,

924
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:02,212
and they get over it 
very quickly, so, you know.

925
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,281
But now, 
it's standard procedure.

926
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,583
The anesthesia is 
not always effective,

927
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,286
and it doesn't eliminate 
all the pain.

928
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,388
The topical is 
the least effective,

929
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,224
and the ring block, when it 
works, is the most effective,

930
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,226
but it take four injections 
into the penis, which hurts.

931
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,161
The procedure is painless.

932
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:22,699
I mean, nowadays, if you 
see somebody that's a real--

933
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,434
has done quite a few,

934
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,603
very often, the baby sleeps 
through the procedure.

935
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:30,073
Well, sometimes infants 
appear to be sleeping.

936
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:33,977
through a circumcision, 
and that's an interpretation 
of adults.

937
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:37,581
What's actually happening is 
the baby is withdrawing

938
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,283
and a traumatic shock.

939
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,151
This is the only thing 
they can do.

940
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:43,587
They can't escape physically, 
so escape psychologically.

941
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,323
The idea that infants 
don't remember pain

942
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:47,758
is another one 
of those cultural myths.

943
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:50,727
Yes, the pain can be remembered.

944
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,264
The study by Taddio 
many years ago,

945
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:57,167
who looked at the response 
to immunization.

946
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,503
[Marilyn] 
One group of these babies 
being vaccinated

947
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:02,606
responded so dramatically 
to pain, they said, "What 
the heck is this about?"

948
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,575
And they went to see 
what were the differences.

949
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,778
Were they breastfed 
verses bottle fed?

950
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:11,181
Were they held more? No. 
It was the boys who'd 
been circumcised

951
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:14,184
that responded 
hysterically to the vaccination

952
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,153
or responded much more 
dramatically to the pain.

953
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:20,057
And the investigators 
explained this by saying,

954
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,794
"This is a result 
of neurological effects 
from a circumcision

955
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:28,398
and a symptom 
of post-traumatic 
stress disorder.

956
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:32,436
When we were 
taping the circumcision 
at the hospital...

957
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:37,107
suddenly their light was 
on that baby's penis,

958
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,408
and the nurse was scrubbing,

959
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,645
so the baby gets an erection.

960
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:43,580
That's the first thing that 
happens, the baby gets a--

961
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,816
this is the baby's first 
shared sexual experience.

962
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:49,086
Having been sexually 
abused as a child,

963
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,489
the feeling in my stomach 
was the same as it had been

964
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:55,692
as a sexually-abused child, 
and I thought, "This is 
sexual abuse."

965
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,627
That-- that was when I got it.

966
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,730
And then to hear the scream, 
and I thought, "Oh my God,

967
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:03,800
not only is this child abuse 
and sexual abuse, 
it's violence."

968
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,304
So it's where sex and violence 
meets for the first time,

969
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:12,442
and every sexual experience 
is on that neuronal 
background of pain.

970
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:16,279
By repressing those early, 
powerful feelings,

971
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:21,118
we make it more 
difficult to experience 
and express any feeling,

972
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,353
because defenses 
don't work that way.

973
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:27,190
They-- they work generally. 
I view this not just 
as a symptom

974
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,360
of circumcised man, but it's 
also a cultural symptom,

975
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:33,663
because culturally, 
we tend to avoid...

976
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:36,700
information about circumcision.

977
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:41,505
I asked a group of men, 
"Please estimate the size 
in square inches...

978
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:45,675
of an adult foreskin." 
I got a range of responses

979
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,745
from one-half square inch...

980
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:53,417
up to maybe about six 
or eight square inches.

981
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,588
The men who tended to minimize 
the area of adult foreskin

982
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:04,261
tended to be the 
ones who felt more okay 
about being circumcised.

983
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:10,600
The actual area of the adult 
foreskin may be 12 square inches 
or even more.

984
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,703
If men don't recognize 
the harm that's done to them,

985
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,740
they're likely to say, 
"Hey, I'm okay."

986
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:20,477
There's also a psychological 
motivation here,

987
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:25,282
and that is... 
how men feel about 
their sexual anatomy

988
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,350
is critical 
to their self-esteem.

989
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:31,421
One of the main 
reasons people are reluctant 
to discuss it is that...

990
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,659
people don't want 
to be seen as...

991
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:39,729
weak or damaged

992
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:43,533
but... that's what 
circumcision does,

993
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,902
is it damages the penis.

994
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:50,173
It's an assault 
on the sexuality of men.

995
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:53,810
And I struggled with it. 
I struggled with it 
for many years.

996
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,713
I went through 
a period of denial.

997
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:58,849
I didn't wanna 
accept that...

998
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:03,487
what happened to me 
was significant.

999
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,589
I had to go through 
a period of grieving.

1000
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,324
I mean, it's-- it's a loss.

1001
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:11,394
It's not just a loss of skin 
or a part of the penis.

1002
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:13,263
It's a loss of trust.

1003
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,232
You grew up feeling like...

1004
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:19,636
those who were there 
to protect you, didn't,

1005
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:24,274
those who were there 
to look out for your 
best interests, didn't.

1006
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,476
And it kind 
of makes you question--

1007
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,279
at least for me-- 
"Who can you trust?"

1008
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:34,851
Distrust is a potential 
post-traumatic stress 
disorder symptom

1009
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,521
among circumcised men 
who are aware

1010
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:40,824
of the harm 
of their circumcision.

1011
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:42,726
All of the men 
who've talked to me

1012
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,895
have told me-- 
well, almost all of them--

1013
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,397
have told me that 
they don't want to talk 
to anyone else about it,

1014
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:51,468
because they're afraid 
of how harsh people's 
reactions will be to them.

1015
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:55,772
If you are willing 
to accept a man's feelings 
about circumcision,

1016
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:59,509
then-- as valid, then you have 
to question circumcision.

1017
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,912
So, if you're not willing 
to question circumcision,

1018
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,881
then you have to trivialize 
the feelings of the survivor.

1019
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:07,617
I hear from men 
who are extremely angry

1020
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,419
about having been circumcised.

1021
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,021
Feeling alone because 
everyone else thinks its fine,

1022
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:12,489
but they think it's not fine.

1023
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,357
I hear from men 
who feel a lot of grief.

1024
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,459
Feeling like there's this--

1025
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,828
this sexism that's hurt them 
that no one notices.

1026
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,898
Men ask, you know, 
"Why was this forced on me?

1027
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,467
And it's my body, 
it should be my choice."

1028
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:28,038
I've talked with a few men 
who say they feel like 
they have some kind flashback,

1029
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:32,642
like, uh... phenomena 
where they have 
these dreams occasionally

1030
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,378
that are violent dreams 
where somebody's holding 
them down and...

1031
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:42,986
So some men have 
a real lot of things that 
they're working through,

1032
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:45,922
and they're working 
through them a lot more alone 
than I wish they would be,

1033
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:50,961
because-- because of society's 
lack of concern for them.

1034
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,698
We haven't talked at all 
about foreskin restoration.

1035
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,767
Restoring works by 
tissue expansion methods.

1036
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:01,538
[William Stowell] You end up 
with a convincing-looking 
replica foreskin

1037
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,907
that does the job of protecting 
the head of your penis

1038
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,877
but doesn't actually have 
any of the sensory 
and neurological

1039
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,746
benefits that a real 
foreskin would have.

1040
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:14,718
Since we started, there have 
been a plethora of devices.

1041
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,988
These are just... a hodgepodge

1042
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,890
of different restoration devices 
I've picked up along the way.

1043
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,826
They all work in, 
basically, the same way.

1044
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,829
They all put extra tension on 
the remnant foreskin you have,

1045
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,832
and by putting gentle, 
constant pressure on it,

1046
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,834
you promote the growth 
of new skin cells.

1047
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,036
This should not be construed 
as medical advice.

1048
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,838
You should see 
a qualified physician

1049
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:38,341
before beginning any 
foreskin-restoration program...

1050
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,843
so they can laugh you 
out of the office.

1051
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:42,912
There's a guy who runs 
a company, TLC Tugger,

1052
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:47,417
who actually makes these, 
and this is a very, very 
quality device.

1053
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,986
I finally decided, "You know 
what? I'm 38 years old,

1054
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,622
"What is going on 
with my own penis?

1055
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,658
"Why is it-- 
why does it seem to me

1056
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:56,626
"like I'm getting 
more and more numb?

1057
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,762
I can't believe nature would 
play such a cruel joke."

1058
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,698
So then I went online, 
and I learned that there 
were men restoring,

1059
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,667
but it sounded 
really challenging.

1060
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,469
But in 2001, I finally decided, 
"I gotta pull the trigger.

1061
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:09,706
I'm not gonna let this get 
any worse. I'm gonna see if 
this restoring can help me."

1062
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,841
And I continued restoring 
for four years.

1063
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,978
May of 2003, 
I finally had a way

1064
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,846
of making my own device

1065
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,982
that I felt I could make 
'em for other people.

1066
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:22,519
This is my workbench. 
I keep different sizes 
of molds that I've made.

1067
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,487
There's just tons 
of different sizes of those.

1068
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,756
We have people that come in 
every size that people come in.

1069
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,693
So, to use our devices, 
a circumcised man

1070
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:32,362
will place the head of his penis 
here in this recess...

1071
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:35,732
and then he takes 
the skin he's got left

1072
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:39,569
rolls it up the shaft, 
and forces it onto the outside

1073
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,938
of this white Tugger body.

1074
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:44,874
Then he puts the 
clear retaining cone 
over that skin

1075
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:47,744
that's bunched up there, 
and when you pull 
on that handle,

1076
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,979
instead of slipping loose, 
it actually gets tighter

1077
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,949
and so you can 
add a strap tension 
or you can hang a weight

1078
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:56,186
and wear that 
for 10, 12 hours a day, 
whatever you wanna do.

1079
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:01,057
Based on the number of men 
that we help and a survey 
that I conducted in 2010,

1080
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:05,061
my best guess is maybe 
a quarter-million men worldwide

1081
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,964
are actively restoring. 
A quarter of a million 
restoring is a lot,

1082
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:10,467
when you consider that...

1083
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,769
there's a whole lot 
of people who've never 
even heard about it.

1084
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,138
And there's plenty 
of people who would never 
even think to undo it.

1085
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:19,642
The thing that's interesting 
about this, it's very folkloric, 
and from the bottom up.

1086
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:22,479
This is something men 
invented for themselves.

1087
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,180
This is not something the 
medical community invented,

1088
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,583
and so everybody's 
proud of their own method.

1089
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:30,120
The one that I've been 
using the most is this one 
called the RecapEZ.

1090
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:33,223
The best thing is 
these all have the 
funniest names available.

1091
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:34,557
I'm entirely aware of that.

1092
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,126
I even have a method.

1093
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,994
My method's different 
than other people's methods.

1094
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:41,164
The easiest way to get started 
with restoration is just--

1095
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,767
we used to think it didn't work,

1096
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,502
but it works quite well-- 
is manual tugging.

1097
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:48,638
You know, you may just 
grab ahold, pull the skin,

1098
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:51,474
hold it for 10 seconds, 
relax for 30.

1099
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,076
Do it again.

1100
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,145
Having helped so many men 
and having restored myself

1101
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,914
I have a sort of a formula for 
how to restore successfully.

1102
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,083
It's really about adding 
tension to your skin

1103
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:03,887
10, 12 hours a day, 
wearing the retaining cone 
every other minute,

1104
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,122
and just letting the 
calendar do the work.

1105
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:08,925
There are no tricks. 
There's nothing you 
can rub on there.

1106
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,494
No ointment. 
It just takes time.

1107
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,830
It really takes a commitment.

1108
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:15,999
Not everybody's gonna 
be able to do this.

1109
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:19,102
To get there, guys might 
need five, six years.

1110
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,039
What is lost in circumcision

1111
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:26,943
is-- is mainly about

1112
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:31,815
80,000 to 100,000 
Meissner corpuscles

1113
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:35,618
that are 
the pleasure center nerves.

1114
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:41,891
What you get back is the feel 
nerves in the glans.

1115
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:44,093
When a penis 
has been circumcised,

1116
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,796
that is it lacks 
the normal foreskin,

1117
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:51,801
then the surface 
of the glans is exposed.

1118
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:54,871
It's open to the air, 
which has a drying effect,

1119
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,674
and its open to being 
subject to friction

1120
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:00,076
from clothing, from bedding,

1121
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:03,680
and... the surface is constantly 
rubbed and abraded.

1122
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:06,716
As a result, the body has 
a natural response

1123
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:10,887
of accumulating 
a thick, tough layer

1124
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,590
so that the nerve endings aren't

1125
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,091
constantly bombarded 
with sensations.

1126
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:17,293
That sometimes has been 
called Keratinization

1127
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,963
because if you analyze that 
tissue under a microscope,

1128
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,731
you might find keratine.

1129
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:23,633
When a guy starts restoring, 
one of the milestones

1130
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,869
he's often looking for 
is de-keratinization.

1131
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:29,239
Within the first few weeks, 
of-- of restoration,

1132
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:34,244
men notice their glans is once 
again glossy and mucosal.

1133
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:36,846
That changes sex dramatically.

1134
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,885
You get a more ticklish, 
if you will, sensation 
during intimacy,

1135
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:44,687
and it just makes 
you feel more alive

1136
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:48,625
to really be experiencing and 
feeling more of what's there.

1137
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:50,660
Um, as time went on,

1138
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,863
I did start to appreciate 
that actually having slack skin

1139
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:58,001
that could be manipulated 
and slinked up and 
down the shaft

1140
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:01,638
during intimacy 
was overwhelmingly 
more important.

1141
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,173
In sexual intercourse,

1142
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,610
you thrust within 
your own skin tube,

1143
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:12,081
and this does away 
with the need for any 
kind of a lubricant.

1144
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:13,917
It was an experience 
I couldn't even describe.

1145
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,853
I mean, I know the difference 
between dry and dull

1146
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,888
and delightfully ticklish,

1147
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,824
but I never knew the difference 
between friction only

1148
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,894
and a slinking, gliding, 
sumptuous massage,

1149
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:26,796
which can happen when 
there's all this slack skin.

1150
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,766
The other thing I've-- 
I hear occasionally

1151
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:32,869
is that guys are experiencing 
what they call

1152
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:36,372
a full-body orgasm 
that isn't just...

1153
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:42,779
a minute or less. I mean, 
it goes on for a few minutes.

1154
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:46,249
And... they're definitely 
getting more out of it.

1155
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:50,320
My main message 
for circumcised men,

1156
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,255
especially in America 
where it's so prevalent,

1157
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,891
is "If you only knew.

1158
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,793
Foreskin feels really good."

1159
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:58,895
You know, as I see it, 
the big draw to becoming

1160
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,698
a restorer is that it's 
gonna improve your sex life.

1161
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,834
But not everybody gets 
into it for that reason.

1162
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:07,870
It's not always, you know, 
a positive, uplifting thing.

1163
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,740
Sometimes it causes to surface 
these-- these feelings

1164
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,042
of reminding you 
of your victimhood.

1165
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:17,013
But for the most part, 
you just-- you grieve that.

1166
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:21,918
I have had, 
during my tenure in NORM...

1167
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:28,057
quite a number of men who 
were just absolutely livid

1168
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,193
about having been cut,

1169
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:33,863
and they want 
to kill doctors, 
kill parents,

1170
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:35,832
sue them, whatever.

1171
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:38,301
And they are 
very, very angry.

1172
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:40,903
And of course, we try 
and calm 'em down,

1173
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:44,374
and tell 'em to, 
probably, start restoring.

1174
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:47,844
I realized... 
that I'd been robbed.

1175
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,714
You know? It's an invasion.

1176
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:54,817
They stole something from me.

1177
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,719
That was probably 
my main motivation--

1178
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:59,455
I took that anger, rechanneled 
it into restoration.

1179
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:03,059
Of the letters we get, 
some of the more 
memorable ones

1180
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:08,798
were people who said... 
"I-- I was unable to complete,

1181
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,167
"if you will, 
sex acts with my wife

1182
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,169
"because I wasn't 
feeling a thing.

1183
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:16,272
"And so we couldn't 
have children,

1184
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:19,409
"'cause our sex wasn't putting

1185
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,978
"my reproductive stuff in 
with her reproductive stuff.

1186
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,747
"But since I restored, 
we now have a child,

1187
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,282
and we're gonna 
name him after you."

1188
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,718
It's very satisfying to know 
that somebody who was...

1189
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:32,321
at some point in their life 
must've felt they were 
out of options

1190
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,858
and that they just didn't get 
to have the full measure 
of human experience,

1191
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:40,463
discovers us, and now they're-- 
they're back in the game.

1192
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:45,368
The foreskin really is 
not important for sex.

1193
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:47,537
Men who have been 
circumcised as adults

1194
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:50,173
can tell the story best, 
especially men

1195
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,775
who were circumcised 
for no medical reason.

1196
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:57,080
I found out the hard way. 
I got circumcised 
at an older age.

1197
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:58,347
I mean, it wasn't botched.

1198
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,949
It was just 
a regular circumcision.

1199
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,784
It was like losing 
your eyesight,

1200
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:04,520
losing-- like being able to--

1201
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,457
like eating food and not being 
able to taste food anymore.

1202
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,392
The doctor, he...

1203
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:11,994
I called him up, 
and told him

1204
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:15,832
how upset I was that this is--

1205
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:19,001
and he goes, 
"It's usually 
not like that.

1206
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:21,537
You know, it's you." 
And he goes, "I gotta go.

1207
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,873
I have patients." 
And he hung up on me.

1208
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,943
So he was very 
dismissive with me,

1209
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,478
and then he sent-- 
[scoffs] it's funny.

1210
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,580
He sent-- he sent something 
in the mail saying

1211
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:32,915
the whole thing was paid for.

1212
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:35,251
Well, I didn't pay 
for the whole thing, 
so I think he was scared.

1213
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,820
They'll say, "There's-- 
no other guys complain,"

1214
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:40,990
but when the guys 
do complain, they'll say, 
"Oh, you're exaggerating,"

1215
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,192
so this is-- this is 
a no-win situation.

1216
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:45,294
I got into a deep 
depression and stuff,

1217
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:47,196
but I realized that 
I had to help myself,

1218
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,198
'cause of lot of people...

1219
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:52,335
want-- wants to minimize 
the trauma, 'cause it is trauma.

1220
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:54,137
Even I was scared 
to talk about it at first,

1221
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:57,240
'cause I-- you get 
a very hostile reaction,

1222
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,475
and I'm like... [scoffs] 
"Oh you did that to yourself,"

1223
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:02,512
or "Get over it." 
It's like-- no, I'm speaking,

1224
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:05,081
'cause I didn't 
know better then. 
And now I know.

1225
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:08,918
I know that you can't take away 
half the central nerve endings

1226
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,921
from a penis 
and still experience sex 
the same way.

1227
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,358
But if somebody says, 
"I got cut for this 
and that reason

1228
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:19,896
and sex is better now 
because I no longer have 
this or that problem."

1229
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:21,931
Good for them. 
That's an adult choice 
they can make,

1230
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,566
and I'm tickled they were 
in a position to make it,

1231
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,001
and didn't have 
it forced upon them.

1232
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:26,602
I'm not against circumcision.

1233
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:31,107
You know? 
Not against it at all.

1234
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:35,244
If you're a consenting adult, 
you can do whatever you want.

1235
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:38,347
But to take 
a defenseless baby...

1236
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:41,517
and strap it down, and...

1237
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,987
sexually mutilate it, 
I'm against.

1238
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:48,424
I think for a lot of people,

1239
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:50,326
they have a sense in their mind,

1240
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:52,061
"This is what 
a normal penis is."

1241
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:54,397
The main reason 
parents say that they

1242
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,465
select a circumcision 
for their child,

1243
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,467
is because-- it's something 
to do with appearance,

1244
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,503
because they want their child 
to look like their dad,

1245
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:03,039
because they want 
their child to look like 
their children's peers,

1246
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,908
or because they think 
a circumcised penis 
looks better.

1247
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:10,479
All of those I really wish 
would drive a chill down 
our spines,

1248
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,449
thinking like, "Is this 
what we want to be 
doing as parents?"

1249
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:15,451
The idea that the parents...

1250
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:20,189
have a right to mold 
their children's appearance

1251
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:24,160
such that it suits 
them, I think is a 
really frightening idea,

1252
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:27,029
and I don't want our society 
to move in that direction.

1253
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:30,032
Your child may come back 
to you 18 years later and say,

1254
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:35,304
"Mom, Dad, you chose 
to have a part of my body 
removed that I want."

1255
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,040
I knew I needed 
to confront my parents.

1256
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,076
It was something 
that didn't seem right,

1257
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:42,678
and it was something that 
was already done to me.

1258
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,548
Three days after I read 
all this about it,

1259
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,117
my mom was going 
down to the living room.

1260
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,419
and my lip was 
kind of quivering.

1261
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:53,689
I was really nervous, 
'cause I was already 
fairly upset abut this.

1262
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:57,059
I'd said, "Well, I found out 
what circumcision was."

1263
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:59,929
And I said, 
"Well, why was it done to me?"

1264
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,267
And she'd kind 
of talked in circles

1265
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:09,138
about it was a cosmetic thing, 
it was parental preference...

1266
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:12,541
claimed that parents 
own their children,

1267
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,543
and-- I do remember this 
word for word--

1268
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,480
used the term, 
"You are mine."

1269
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:20,616
It was really frustrating 
to hear that, obviously.

1270
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,585
I think it's kind of frustrating 
for anyone to be told

1271
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:25,121
by someone else, 
"Hey, I own you."

1272
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:28,624
I just tried to say, 
"But I don't like it,

1273
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:31,193
and it's-- it was my body 
that was affected."

1274
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,562
And she didn't take 
that well, either.

1275
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,498
It ended up turning 
into a screaming match

1276
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:38,000
where she had gotten up 
and just knocked over

1277
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:41,203
a bunch of cups on the table 
and kicked them in my direction.

1278
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:44,740
And I was on the couch crying, 
and I was trying to form words

1279
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,610
to explain to her how upset 
and how sad I was,

1280
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,646
but she was feeling the exact 
same way towards me.

1281
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:57,119
This was the spark 
that started the terrible 
relationship we have now.

1282
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:01,724
[Aubrey] 
You know, you have a little boy, 
he's circumcised,

1283
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,727
but he's expected 
to get what he wants

1284
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:09,265
without hitting or without 
hurting or manipulating 
other people.

1285
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:13,302
So there comes a time 
when he's going to realize

1286
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:16,238
that part of his body 
was forcibly removed,

1287
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:20,676
and he may have any number 
of reactions to that reality,

1288
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:24,146
but subconsciously, 
the truth is

1289
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:27,183
it's allowable for someone 
who's bigger than you

1290
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:29,752
to hold you down and do 
what they want to your body,

1291
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:32,488
'cause it fit their opinion 
of what was okay to do.

1292
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:36,759
And so you have a real 
disconnect between the concept

1293
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:39,128
of equality and the reality.

1294
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,530
And I just don't think 
that it's possible

1295
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:44,800
for us to grow 
with that poison 
sitting there.

1296
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:48,838
If we wanna be 
a real free people like 
we claim that we are,

1297
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:52,108
we can't do that and have 
that underlying lesson

1298
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:54,543
taught at our 
most vulnerable time.

1299
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,215
As time goes by, it goes 
from just the knowledge

1300
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:00,816
that it's not something 
for my kids

1301
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,386
to moving into the activism.

1302
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:06,689
Then the more you know 
about things, the more 
you want to stop them.

1303
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,424
Are we cool? 
[laughs] Sorry.

1304
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,292
I think it's important 
to come with the kids too.

1305
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,328
I know there are people that 
say, "The signs are graphic.

1306
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,630
Kids shouldn't see that," 
but it's real, it happens,

1307
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:17,299
and hiding it from them-- 
what's the point of that?

1308
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,668
My son is not even four, 
he knows it's wrong,

1309
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,104
he knows that it hurts 
the babies to do that. 
He gets it.

1310
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:26,108
[boy] 
I think we don't-- 
don't cut baby's penises off,

1311
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,411
yeah, because that's not nice.

1312
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,680
[Emily] 
"I think we don't cut penises 
off, because that's not nice,"

1313
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,549
and this is 
the stuff that he says.

1314
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,584
When we see the signs, "Mommy, 
why is that baby crying?"

1315
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:37,787
"Well, it's sad." 
"Well, what's happening?"

1316
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,156
And we explained 
that doctors tie him down,

1317
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:42,158
they cut off part of his penis, 
and it hurts him a lot,

1318
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:43,859
and he'll say to me, 
"It's mean!

1319
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,661
They shouldn't be 
allowed to do that." 
He gets it.

1320
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:48,264
It hurts a woman to know 
that the man you love

1321
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:51,667
or a man you want to love, 
or your father, or--

1322
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:55,438
or your best friend growing up, 
that someone hurt him

1323
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,773
in the worst way they could, 
and that nobody cared.

1324
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:01,777
And there are a lot of nights 
where I will sit up until 
2:00 in the morning

1325
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:05,748
reading, reading, reading, 
and trying to get my mind 
off of things, and...

1326
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:09,385
I can't, I'm crying, 
I'm crying for my brothers,

1327
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,788
and I'm crying for my father, 
and for all the boys that 
nobody cares to save,

1328
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:14,623
all the boys that, you know--

1329
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,659
if somebody would've just said, 
"Have you thought about this?"

1330
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:20,162
or if a doctor wouldn't 
have been a complete asshole

1331
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:23,466
and convinced a mother that 
she had to mutilate her son

1332
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,167
'cause it's necessary 
for whatever reason.

1333
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:27,636
I don't know. I don't know 
how you can know

1334
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,572
this exists in the world 
and not wanna stop it.

1335
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,907
In all of my flaws 
and all of my failings,

1336
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:35,411
I know that at least 
I didn't do that to them.

1337
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,346
I can't imagine...

1338
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:40,816
I don't know. 
I can't imagine the regret

1339
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,818
of knowing that you 
did that to your son

1340
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:45,421
and then learning 
that it was wrong.

1341
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,457
It's time for our culture 
to stop being complacent 
about circumcisions.

1342
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:50,559
It's time to go out and be 
part of that ethical correction.

1343
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:53,262
So, thank you very much.

1344
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:57,466
Well, we went into the doctor, 
she did the circumcision,

1345
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,401
and his penis 
was fine before that.

1346
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:02,438
I heard him scream, 
which was horrible.

1347
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,740
I tried to get in there, 
but they had locked the door.

1348
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:06,775
And...

1349
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:11,614
Once she allowed me to go in,

1350
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,250
she said that he had 
a concealed penis.

1351
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:18,787
Well, what I didn't know 
until recently is that it was 
a botched circumcision.

1352
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:22,992
I had told her that 
he looked normal before,

1353
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:24,927
and she just said that...

1354
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:29,932
basically, I didn't know 
what I was talking about.

1355
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,667
because she does this every day.

1356
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,636
[man] 
At what point 
did you start to realize

1357
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:36,539
that this was something 
the doctor had done

1358
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:38,741
rather than something 
he was born with?

1359
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:43,546
Yesterday.

1360
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:49,685
I knew something 
was wrong all along, 
but I knew yesterday

1361
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:52,655
when I was watching 
the speakers.

1362
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:56,425
During-- Marilyn, she was 
showing these slides,

1363
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,028
I saw my son's penis on there-- 
concealed penis--

1364
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:01,597
and she said that 
it was a botched circumcision.

1365
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:05,267
What happens here is 
either the doctor has 
removed too much tissue

1366
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:07,303
on the foreskin--

1367
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:09,405
[Shannondoah] 
And that's when I realized 
what had happened.

1368
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:14,376
And then... it was-- it was 
a really hard day for me.

1369
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,780
I-- I haven't had a day 
that hard in a long time.

1370
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:19,782
I...

1371
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:26,522
I realize that I did 
something to my son 
I shouldn't have done.

1372
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:32,995
Some-- some men 
feel like it is...

1373
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,800
is as bad as being raped.

1374
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:47,576
How could I have 
done that to my son?

1375
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,380
What if he feels 
that way one day?

1376
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,595
I didn't have the right 
to do that to him,

1377
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:10,766
and I didn't know 
until I went to the NOCIRC 
conference yesterday.

1378
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:17,940
Yes, some of these are 
disturbing, but until we really 
see what circumcision is

1379
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:20,809
and it's impact upon humans--

1380
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,911
while these things may 
not happen very often,

1381
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,580
if it's you, 
it's significant.

1382
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,081
There's not 
a single state 
in the US

1383
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,718
that requires outpatient 
circumcision reporting.

1384
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:31,754
And no doctor's required 
to report a botch,

1385
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,556
and I talk to pediatricians 
all the time who say, "I see

1386
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,559
two, three botches a week, 
but what can I do?"

1387
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,995
[Gillian] 
John, you're mentioning no--

1388
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:41,864
no way to track what 
goes on in the outpatient.

1389
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:43,999
There's no way to track what 
goes on in the inpatient either,

1390
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:46,502
because nobody's 
keeping statistics. 
There is no nationalized system

1391
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:49,371
for tracking adverse events 
aftr circumcisions,

1392
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:51,373
so we don't really know 
how many babies die,

1393
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:53,809
or need antibiotics 
or blood transfusions. 
We don't know.

1394
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:55,444
[man] 
Yeah, I was just gonna ask...

1395
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:02,918
I'm gonna educate 
myself more, and...

1396
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,423
I'm going to...

1397
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:09,825
be an Intactivist.

1398
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:21,370
I'm gonna put 
the information out there.

1399
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:24,406
I'm gonna do what 
I can to make sure

1400
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,911
that other women and other men 
don't do this to their children.

1401
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:40,456
Hopefully, in educating 
other people,

1402
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:43,726
I can stop this from happening 
to anyone else.

1403
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,062
At least... 
some people, you know?

1404
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:51,533
I-- I-- I feel violated.

1405
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:54,503
I also want to give a voice 
to the ways that parents

1406
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,705
are ethically violated 
by circumcision.

1407
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,142
[reading out loud]

1408
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,188
If I would've known...

1409
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:16,625
before that scream...

1410
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:21,063
that it would've hurt him, 
I wouldn't have done it,

1411
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,565
but she told me he wasn't 
going to feel anything.

1412
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:27,102
She totally lied to me.

1413
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:29,872
I've always been talking 
to doctors about it.

1414
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:34,009
But nobody ever told me that 
it was something that happened

1415
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:37,880
because of a botched 
circumcision until yesterday.

1416
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:41,016
I talked to Kathya, 
and she's the first person

1417
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:43,185
that told me that's not normal.

1418
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:45,053
They gave me no information.

1419
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,656
Yeah, yeah. I mean a lot of 
the people that I approach,

1420
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:50,759
that I start talking to 
at like 20 weeks, they--

1421
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:54,263
they don't even know that 
that's like something 
that's not necessary,

1422
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:57,166
that's cosmetic, that there 
are repercussions, anything.

1423
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,035
[man] 
Did Kathya know before 
the conference yesterday?

1424
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,871
Yes. Maybe that's why 
she asked me to go.

1425
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:04,840
[indistinct chatter]

1426
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:09,077
Parents should 
know that these...

1427
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,882
accidents are 
extremely common.

1428
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:16,652
When I did a case 
for a young man,

1429
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:19,988
who had had too much 
shaft skin removed

1430
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:22,825
and too much 
inner foreskin lining left,

1431
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:26,995
which resulted in a repair 
where there's sort of a bulge 
in the middle of the penis--

1432
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,497
it's rather unsightly.

1433
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:35,671
His own doctor volunteered 
to the defense a video

1434
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:40,909
in which he said, 
"This isn't malpractice. 
I repair one of these a week."

1435
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:42,644
Of course that does not follow.

1436
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:44,746
Merely because 
he repairs one a week

1437
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,782
doesn't mean 
it's not malpractice.

1438
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,784
What it means is 
there's a lot of malpractice.

1439
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,753
The complication rate 
of newborn circumcision

1440
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:54,756
is about three-tenths 
of one percent--

1441
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:57,593
anywhere between 
0.1 and 0.5--

1442
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:02,297
anywhere between one in 200 
and one in a thousand,

1443
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,700
and they're almost all minor.

1444
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:06,602
Of course, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics

1445
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:09,638
claims that the circumcision 
complication rate is under 2%.

1446
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,240
Well, let's think 
about this for a second,

1447
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:13,742
just as-- just as 
non-medical people.

1448
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,212
Who-- who determines where 
the complications occur

1449
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:20,048
and when they occur? 
And the answer is the 
hospital, right?

1450
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:24,052
The kid gets circumcised 
on Monday and maybe has 
complications on Tuesday,

1451
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,854
but if they send 
him home Wednesday,

1452
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:27,789
the hospital never hears 
about the complications.

1453
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,591
There are lots 
of botched circumcisions

1454
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,927
or-- the complaints 
of adult men:

1455
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,596
Why-- why do I have 
skin bridges?

1456
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:36,865
Why do I have hunks 
and slices missing?

1457
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:39,668
Why do I have a curvature? 
Why do I have tight erections?

1458
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,803
Painful erections? 
Tearing at the scar site?

1459
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:44,106
Unfortunately, for those of us 
who have been circumcised,

1460
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:46,308
we'll never know what our penis 
was meant to look like.

1461
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:49,177
The penis you have now 
is a man-made penis.

1462
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:52,314
Somebody cut into it, 
and they arbitrarily decided

1463
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:54,850
how much of your penis 
they would take.

1464
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:58,220
And so now, your penis looks 
like... what they thought 
it should look like...

1465
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:02,124
which has varying results.

1466
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:06,261
You know, a lot of the time, 
there's that phenomenon some 
people call "boner's arc,"

1467
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:09,131
where their penis is bent 
to one side or the other.

1468
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:11,033
I would say, 
nine times out of 10,

1469
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,936
if you look, the scar tissue, 
behind the head of your penis--

1470
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:16,104
say if your penis is bent 
to the left a little bit,

1471
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,774
you'll notice that the scar 
is wider on the left,

1472
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:21,109
where they've taken 
so much skin

1473
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:23,078
that there's actually 
enough tension there

1474
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:25,747
that it causes 
your penis to obtain 
that bend over time.

1475
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:28,917
Nobody has ever assembled 
all the complications

1476
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:31,920
of circumcision, 
including the adult fallout--

1477
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:33,789
especially adult fallout-- ever.

1478
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:35,857
If you talked 
to an honest pediatrician

1479
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,392
about the number 
of damaged boys

1480
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,127
he sees in a month, 
you'd be astonished.

1481
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,698
We did 1,600 
circumcision revisions.

1482
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:48,370
Many times, the lowest person 
on the totem pole was 
asked to do it.

1483
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:50,005
You've probably heard 
the old expression,

1484
01:16:50,038 --> 01:16:52,240
"See one, do one, teach one,"

1485
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,210
which is often used 
in residency programs.

1486
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:58,680
And sadly, that often happens.

1487
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:00,882
These are some 
of the instruments 
that are used.

1488
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:04,920
This is a Sheldon clamp. 
This company has just been 
put out of business...

1489
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,223
because it's injured 
too many babies.

1490
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:10,225
This is a foreskin 
in a Sheldon clamp.

1491
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:12,928
This clamp has caused 
the amputation

1492
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,963
of the glans 
or parts of the glans.

1493
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:16,732
But imagine that...

1494
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,334
[clears throat] 
being clamped

1495
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:22,404
onto a penis, 
onto a foreskin. 
It's here.

1496
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:24,106
This is a Gomco clamp...

1497
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,175
and it's thousands of pounds

1498
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,745
of pressure is put on--

1499
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:31,413
so this is the screw 
that goes down

1500
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:34,116
they bring the baby's 
foreskin up through this,

1501
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,051
and then they start 
screwing it down,

1502
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:39,054
and that tightens 
this cla-- this,

1503
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:41,456
so the foreskin 
is being crushed there.

1504
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,325
The rest of his penis 
is down here.

1505
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:45,827
But imagine that 
on a baby's penis.

1506
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:48,864
Does that look like 
a piece of equipment that 
should be on a baby's penis?

1507
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:50,732
And here it is for an adult.

1508
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,267
Let's go into the Mogen clamp.

1509
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:55,303
Myself and John Juliano 
of East Northport, New York,

1510
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:59,207
obtained a million-dollar 
judgment against Mogen 
Circumcision Instruments.

1511
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:02,811
It involved a ritual 
circumcision by a Jewish mohel

1512
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:06,348
and the mohel did not appreciate 
that you can entrap

1513
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:09,451
the glans penis in the jaws 
of the Mogen clamp.

1514
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,119
He did just that...

1515
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:14,389
and when the child 
continued to bleed...

1516
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:18,160
an other doctor who 
was present noticed it.

1517
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,896
Mogen Circumcision Instruments, 
whom we had sued,

1518
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:24,266
did not answer the lawsuit, 
and they never showed up 
at any hearing.

1519
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,468
Are there Mogen clamps 
being used today

1520
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,870
in hospitals throughout 
the country? Absolutely.

1521
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:32,774
And frankly, I believe 
the design of the Mogen clamp 
is extremely dangerous.

1522
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:35,777
I want to address briefly 
something called the Plastibell.

1523
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,380
The doctor's asked 
to tie off that extra skin

1524
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:40,348
and then because it's tied off,

1525
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,985
it supposedly loses 
its blood supply 
and sloughs away.

1526
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,388
And if for any reason 
that knot is not tied

1527
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:49,091
perfectly tightly, 
it's a source of infection.

1528
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:51,259
The fact that a child 
can die from this

1529
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,361
means I don't think that thing 
should be on the market.

1530
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:56,131
I really think 
that circumcisions

1531
01:18:56,164 --> 01:19:00,202
are in jeopardy if it's always 
the youngest person

1532
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:02,337
who happens to be 
on the OB team.

1533
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:05,340
We would like 
every person bringing 
their child into the office

1534
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:08,944
to realize that it 
is not... mandatory.

1535
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:12,280
And of course many times 
those families say, "We really 
want to get it done."

1536
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:15,217
and that allows me to talk 
about, "Here's how I do it."

1537
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,253
[baby crying]

1538
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:33,568
-[women laugh] 
-[baby cries]

1539
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:36,238
[indistinct chatter]

1540
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:38,607
[Boyd] 
Yeah, you can fuss as much 
as you want, buddy.

1541
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,575
There are a couple points 
in the procedure

1542
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,577
where he's gonna 
get kinda mad at me,

1543
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,913
so don't tell him my name.

1544
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:46,915
And he's gonna have 
to get used to having 
that touched anyways,

1545
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,917
'cause... that's the way it is.

1546
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:52,354
30 gauge needle. 
And this is where he's 
gonna start saying,

1547
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:54,289
"That darn Dr. Winslow.

1548
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:55,891
I don't like that guy."

1549
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:58,527
[baby fussing]

1550
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:01,229
[Boyd] 
I mean, one 
obstetrician told me,

1551
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:03,365
"You don't really need 
to do local anesthesia.

1552
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:06,401
They just go into shock 
right after you start 
doing the procedure,"

1553
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,570
as though that's a-- 
that's a good thing.

1554
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:11,039
Another key 
to local anesthesia: 
We put that down,

1555
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:13,508
we leave him alone 
while it takes effect.

1556
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:29,324
[Boyd] 
That's how you do it. 
Now here's a good clue

1557
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:31,626
that we've done 
a pretty good job 
with our local anesthesia,

1558
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:35,363
'cause he's not really-- 
I saw one toe elevate slightly.

1559
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:43,405
-[baby fussing] 
-[Boyd] Okay, so that's 
where he felt me

1560
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:45,574
-teasing it off the glans. 
-[woman] Mm-hmm.

1561
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,509
[Boyd] 
And he's gotta 
put up with that.

1562
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:50,278
[baby fusses]

1563
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:51,680
[Boyd] 
So there's 
the little frenulum,

1564
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:53,982
and we'll let the clamp 
take care of that.

1565
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:59,921
If you had five elephants 
all piggybacked

1566
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:03,158
on top of each other 
on top of one stiletto heel,

1567
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:06,127
that's the amount of pressure 
that it's putting on that skin.

1568
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:09,097
And it stays on there 
for five minutes

1569
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,499
to achieve fusion 
of those edges.

1570
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:16,571
Do you want to save 
the foreskin? You really don't?

1571
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:21,176
Okay, so now, there's an art 
to removing this clamp.

1572
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:23,678
I'm teasing it off 
this clamp in a way

1573
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,647
-that doesn't rip it or tear it. 
-[crying]

1574
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:30,085
[Boyd] 
We're gonna free him 
from this waterboarding device.

1575
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:32,420
Mom, pick up the-- 
the sweet stuff.

1576
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:35,991
"I want my mama." See that?

1577
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:38,026
Those who do mutilation 
of young girls

1578
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,494
say the same thing.

1579
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:43,231
"Well, now we have 
doctors doing it properly

1580
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:46,067
and giving a local anesthetic, 
so there's no more pain."

1581
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:48,036
"So now I'm gonna say it's okay?

1582
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:50,305
"More power to you. 
Thank you so much.

1583
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:52,707
We're doing this. 
Go and keep mutilating girls."

1584
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,744
No, this is wrong. 
Who gives you the 
right to say it?

1585
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:57,679
So it's same thing 
in America.

1586
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:02,117
The problem is that 
doctors don't know that--

1587
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:05,620
anything about the structures, 
functions, development

1588
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:07,322
and care of the normal penis.

1589
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:09,691
I get a hundred complaints 
a year from parents

1590
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:12,360
whose child-- 
whose intact child, 
not circumcised--

1591
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:16,331
whose intact boy 
was forcibly retracted 
at a doctor's visit.

1592
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:19,234
And the doctors learned 
in medical school

1593
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,469
to retract the foreskin 
to clean under it.

1594
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:24,472
It always has to be 
retractable. You have-- 
and they can't leave it alone.

1595
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:28,243
Well, unfortunately, there's 
a membrane that attaches 
the foreskin to the glans

1596
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:32,414
in infancy, which lasts 
on the average, until age 10

1597
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:36,017
and can last as long 
as age 17, 18, and above.

1598
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:38,420
And that membrane, 
once torn, cannot grow back,

1599
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:41,289
but yet I-- I have 
a hundred cases a year

1600
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:44,326
of-- of doctors who-- 
and nurses--

1601
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:47,729
who forcible retract boys 
because they tell parents, 
"You have to clean in there."

1602
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:50,765
I often had patients 
sent in, who--

1603
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,068
little boys who had 
not been circumcised

1604
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,770
and their pediatrician thought 
that the first thing to do was

1605
01:22:55,804 --> 01:23:00,175
to separate the skin 
and push that foreskin back.

1606
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,444
And we don't 
believe that at all.

1607
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:04,746
The rule is: 
Only clean what is seen.

1608
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:06,448
You do not need 
to clean children internally.

1609
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:08,550
And I would say that 
most children by the time

1610
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:11,353
they've reached puberty have 
a fully-retractable foreskin.

1611
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:14,456
Those two structures 
separate on their own 
over a period of time.

1612
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:17,359
That membrane is 
completely normal.

1613
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:20,228
It's like the female hymen. 
It's part of the body.

1614
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:22,630
It dissipates eventually, 
but it's not a problem.

1615
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,767
Everybody in my generation 
who was intact

1616
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,104
in the 1940s, '50s, '60s 
was forcibly retracted.

1617
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:31,673
Millions and millions 
of American men

1618
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:33,641
were forcibly 
retracted as kids.

1619
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:36,077
Some of them recovered from it, 
some of them did not.

1620
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:38,847
Some of them still have 
sexual troubles they don't 
realize are related

1621
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,483
to what happened 
to them in childhood. 
I'll show you a picture.

1622
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:44,519
This is a picture of a child 
who was forcibly retracted 
at a well-baby visit.

1623
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:46,521
That's a condition 
called paraphimosis,

1624
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:50,158
and at its very worst, 
the glans would begin 
to autoamputate.

1625
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:52,761
What's the excuse for this? 
This-this is--

1626
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:55,597
well, this is a child injured 
at a well-baby visit.

1627
01:23:55,630 --> 01:24:00,201
Our physicians group estimates 
that this happens a hundred 
thousand times a year.

1628
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:03,104
Considering all 
of the foregoing,

1629
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:05,373
what does the AAP 
say about all this?

1630
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:09,577
The AAP, referred to several 
times as the American 
Academy of Pediatrics,

1631
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:12,781
they say, "In cases such 
as the decision to perform

1632
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:15,517
"a circumcision 
in the neonatal period...

1633
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,520
well, it should be the parents 
who determine what's in the 
best interests of the child."

1634
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:22,557
[Georganne] The statement 
that the American Academy 
of Pediatrics came out with

1635
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:26,461
in 2012 was extremely revealing,

1636
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:29,130
because it was 
a real piece of trash.

1637
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:32,367
It was internally inconsistent, 
so it said things like,

1638
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,536
"The benefits 
outweigh the risks,

1639
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,337
"but we don't really 
know what the risks are,

1640
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:38,373
because the risks 
haven't been measured."

1641
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,875
Now right there you got 
a big problem, right?

1642
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:44,746
And they stated this over 
and over. "The risks have not 
been studied systematically."

1643
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:49,250
They also said things like, 
"Reports of deaths

1644
01:24:49,284 --> 01:24:52,520
"and complications 
were not considered

1645
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:55,657
for this article because 
they were case studies."

1646
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:57,392
Those are children who died.

1647
01:24:57,425 --> 01:25:00,428
There were, I believe, 
only five citations

1648
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:02,330
that were references 
to ethical statements.

1649
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:05,433
One of them was the 
AAP's own statement

1650
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,836
about how doctors shouldn't 
operate on their children.

1651
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:10,872
Of course, one of the 
task force members had 
circumcised his own son.

1652
01:25:10,905 --> 01:25:13,475
So, I get called out 
on this all the time,

1653
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:15,510
because in an early interview,

1654
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:17,445
when asked, "Did I have 
my own son circumcised?"

1655
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:20,415
I responded, "I did it myself 
as a religious ceremony."

1656
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:24,652
I did it because of my faith, 
and that's why I did it.

1657
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:28,256
And I didn't do it because 
I think everybody should do it.

1658
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,692
I did it because, 
for me, that's my tribe.

1659
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:32,494
I don't really...

1660
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:39,501
want to hear about... 
innocents' rights of 
some obscure disease,

1661
01:25:39,534 --> 01:25:41,903
you know, 'cause 
that's not really how 
I made my decision.

1662
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:44,606
My decision was 
the non-medical factors,

1663
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:48,643
but at the same time, 
I don't want to hear that 
how I defined my tribe

1664
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:52,747
colors how I counsel others.

1665
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:55,483
So I don't, 
because if you're not 
a member of my tribe,

1666
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:57,685
I want you to do 
what's right for you.

1667
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:02,290
If, clearly, the risks were-- 
significantly outweighed 
the benefits,

1668
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,292
we-- we would 
fess up and say that.

1669
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:07,829
I mean, the AAP has no agenda 
to promote circumcision.

1670
01:26:07,862 --> 01:26:10,398
They just want to promote, 
"What's the science?"

1671
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,668
I also think that there's 
some legal liabilities.

1672
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:15,937
I mean, the American Academy 
of Pediatrics aren't stupid.

1673
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:19,340
William Stowell is suing 
the hospital where he was 
born and circumcised.

1674
01:26:19,374 --> 01:26:22,810
[Geisheker] Their attorneys 
I am sure have told them to 
keep the ball in the air,

1675
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,479
and so they're never 
gonna turn against it.

1676
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,314
When I had gotten involved 
in the movement,

1677
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:28,483
a lot of the people 
that were involved thought

1678
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:30,952
that the best way 
to affect social change 
would be through a lawsuit.

1679
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:34,622
I was turning 18. In many ways, 
I was just in the right 
place at the right time.

1680
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:37,392
They said, "Wouldn't it be 
great if some guy who is

1681
01:26:37,425 --> 01:26:39,394
"really, really bitter about 
what had happened to him

1682
01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:41,462
could file a lawsuit about it?"

1683
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:44,799
And it just seemed 
no question in my mind 
that I had to do it.

1684
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:46,701
We decided to bring the case...

1685
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:51,439
and in the process 
of doing so...

1686
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:54,409
we discovered that his mother 
had not wanted to consent

1687
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:57,312
to a circumcision, 
although she had done so.

1688
01:26:57,345 --> 01:26:59,480
But when we looked 
at his medical records,

1689
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:02,417
we found out that she had 
signed the consent form

1690
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:05,353
early in the morning when she 
was still under the influence

1691
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:09,557
of Demerol and other drugs 
after having delivered him 
by cesarean section.

1692
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:12,827
That's very simple. 
If you're going to get 
a consent from somebody

1693
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:15,530
and you know they're drunk 
or under the influences

1694
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:18,933
of drugs-- drugs that 
may limit their ability

1695
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:22,470
to actually appreciate 
what they're doing, the 
consent's completely invalid.

1696
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:25,506
A wrongful circumcision case, 
of course, is not just

1697
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,809
medical malpractice, 
it is also battery.

1698
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:32,614
I was suing on the-- 
on the idea that I didn't want 
the procedure performed at all,

1699
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:35,783
that it was my body, 
that they didn't ask 
me for consent

1700
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:38,786
regardless of whether there 
even was a consent form that 
my parents had signed.

1701
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:41,556
We were well on our way 
to trial before they settled.

1702
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:44,025
We sued the hospital, 
and they settled with us.

1703
01:27:44,058 --> 01:27:45,827
And then the doctor 
decided to settle with us.

1704
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:49,430
It made me appreciate the power 
that an individual has.

1705
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:52,734
being an activist myself 
has also made me 
feel kind of sad

1706
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:55,403
about the people that 
are armchair warriors, 
so to speak.

1707
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:59,407
So many angry, disgruntled 
people who never do 
anything about it.

1708
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,809
Up until this 
point in history, 
as of right now,

1709
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:03,711
I'm the only man who's 
ever sued his doctor.

1710
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:07,382
I think his case was 
unique in the fact

1711
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:10,351
that his mother had 
not wanted to consent.

1712
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:12,887
It's more difficult when 
you just want to assert,

1713
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,756
"My parents weren't 
able to consent."

1714
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:17,659
Because that at the moment 
is a bold proposition,

1715
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:19,927
although I believe it is 
a correct proposition,

1716
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:24,465
the law generally follows 
society, rather than society 
following the law.

1717
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:28,603
What may be correct 
intellectually may not be 
what a court holds.

1718
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:30,471
I think that's the impediment

1719
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:33,641
of every young man 
suing at 18.

1720
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:38,446
New at 11:00, supporters 
of a circumcision ban

1721
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:40,982
in San Francisco have 
gathered enough signatures

1722
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:43,451
to put that measure 
on the ballot in November.

1723
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:46,487
[reporter] 
Lloyd Schofield is the man 
behind the ballot measure.

1724
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:57,031
[man] Before this initiative, 
did you have any background

1725
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:59,434
in politics or community 
organizing?

1726
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:00,968
No. No, I didn't.

1727
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:04,072
People have tried 
to prevent Jews

1728
01:29:04,105 --> 01:29:05,907
from practicing our religion.

1729
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:10,745
Circumcision is a fundamental, 
integral piece of our practice.

1730
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:13,981
Our chief opponent 
Abby Michelson Porth

1731
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:16,751
of the Jewish Community 
Relations Council

1732
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:20,488
She had a lot of connections. 
She had a lot of power 
and money behind her.

1733
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:22,990
I did have a couple of cordial 
conversations with her.

1734
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:26,627
We were talking about a baby boy 
who died from his circumcision.

1735
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:29,097
She said, "Oh, well, 
he died of anesthesia."

1736
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:31,432
I said, "Well, if he 
hadn't been circumcised,

1737
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:35,036
he wouldn't be given 
the anesthesia, and he 
would not have died."

1738
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:38,206
So I said, "Don't you 
believe babies should 
be given anesthesia

1739
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:41,008
when they go through this 
very, very painful procedure?"

1740
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:44,512
And she said, 
"No, that's my religion."

1741
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,916
I said, "I guess we don't have 
anything else to talk about,"

1742
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:51,085
and that was the last 
I spoke with her.

1743
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:59,026
What happened was 
they took us to Superior Court

1744
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:02,997
to have the ballot initiative 
removed on a technicality.

1745
01:30:05,032 --> 01:30:08,669
I think that if this law 
had a religious exemption, 
it would not have roused

1746
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:12,940
the sleeping lion of people-- 
even though they're a tiny 
percentage of the population--

1747
01:30:12,974 --> 01:30:16,177
who are strongly opposed 
to any sort of regulation

1748
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:18,646
of their religious 
beliefs or practices.

1749
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:21,682
Many religious 
Intactivists said,

1750
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:25,186
"This isn't gonna 
go through unless there's 
a religious exception."

1751
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:27,622
I said, "No, we can't do that. 
It's too late anyway.

1752
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:30,024
"And I would not have-- 
I would not have put 
my name on it.

1753
01:30:30,057 --> 01:30:33,961
"That is antisemitic-- 
is to say Jewish children

1754
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,964
do not deserve the same 
protections as everybody else."

1755
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:39,801
But now, one of the campaign 
tactics that the backers

1756
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:42,103
are using is generating outrage 
in the Jewish community.

1757
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:44,972
[reporter] 
It's an Internet comic 
called "Foreskin Man."

1758
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:50,845
This did a lot of damage 
to the anti-circumcision cause.

1759
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:54,549
Critics say this comic strip 
is blatantly antisemitic.

1760
01:30:54,582 --> 01:30:57,785
Abby Porth showed us 
comparisons of "Foreskin Man"

1761
01:30:57,819 --> 01:31:00,054
and images the Nazis used.

1762
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:02,523
I went on TV, I said, 
"This is one person.

1763
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:04,025
He's not a member 
of our committee."

1764
01:31:04,058 --> 01:31:06,661
That was what our opposition 
was looking for,

1765
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:08,563
and they used it 
very effectively.

1766
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:10,865
We really wanted 
to have a discussion,

1767
01:31:10,898 --> 01:31:13,901
and this gave 
our opponents 
the excuse

1768
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:16,571
they needed to not 
have any discussion.

1769
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:19,207
Circumcision is still thought 
of as a Jewish practice,

1770
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,844
so there's always 
that idea that if you're 
opposed to circumcision,

1771
01:31:22,877 --> 01:31:25,913
what this really is 
is a hidden form 
of antisemitism.

1772
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:28,583
Where it's really coming 
from is that people care

1773
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:30,985
about the welfare of babies

1774
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:33,588
and people care 
about the welfare 
of Jewish babies.

1775
01:31:33,621 --> 01:31:37,725
There is criticism 
of circumcision within 
the Jewish community.

1776
01:31:37,758 --> 01:31:39,694
I'm an example of that,

1777
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:41,963
and there are many 
other examples of that.

1778
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:45,233
My father was a rabbi, so I grew 
up in the Jewish tradition.

1779
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:47,134
This wasn't done 
for my own good.

1780
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:49,837
This was not my 
religious choice to do.

1781
01:31:49,871 --> 01:31:53,241
I was circumcised 
on the eighth day of life 
in a ritual circumcision

1782
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:56,077
[man] What sort 
of feelings came up when you 
were initially learning this?

1783
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:59,614
Uh, rage. Absolute rage.

1784
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:02,984
If Jews respond 
to circumcision critics

1785
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:06,954
with a charge that 
they're being antisemitic...

1786
01:32:07,922 --> 01:32:10,791
this is a way of avoiding 
the merits of the issue.

1787
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:13,160
Well, this is an 
ad hominem attack,

1788
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,997
that means you attack the man 
instead of the argument,

1789
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:18,165
and that way you can 
shift the discussion.

1790
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:21,302
So I'm gonna steal 
the argument and the debate 
back from the people

1791
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:24,605
that wanna talk 
about antisemites,

1792
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:28,643
and I wanna go back to babies 
and why babies have rights.

1793
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:32,213
The baby's religious 
rights means that you 
cannot cut his body,

1794
01:32:32,246 --> 01:32:35,149
because he too, actually, 
is born with religious freedom.

1795
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:39,654
Circumcising someone is 
a violation of that person's 
religious freedom,

1796
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:43,958
that they may-- they may 
grow up and decide 
to not be Jewish,

1797
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:47,762
but now that their 
body's been marked, 
it's too late for them.

1798
01:32:47,795 --> 01:32:50,298
And nowadays, 
you have Jewish families

1799
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:51,899
who are practicing brit shalom.

1800
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:53,834
[Mark Reiss] 
Brit shalom is nothing more

1801
01:32:53,868 --> 01:32:56,671
than a covenantal 
naming ceremony 
without circumcision,

1802
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:59,407
although most think 
in order to be Jewish, 
you gotta be ircumcised.

1803
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:02,376
Jewish identity is 
purely matrilineal.

1804
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,946
In other words, you don't have 
to be circumcised to be Jewish.

1805
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:08,115
There's definitely not one 
thought on this within Judaism,

1806
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:13,154
and... I certainly don't want 
the Anti-Defamation League 
speaking for me.

1807
01:33:13,187 --> 01:33:16,290
I felt that being Jewish, 
it was really important that 
I protest as a Jew.

1808
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:19,827
A rabbi came up to me and told 
me that I was doing the right 
thing, fighting for change.

1809
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,129
Any time that I am 
at a circumcision

1810
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:27,735
all the feelings that you're 
confrontizing in this are there.

1811
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:30,338
People know something's off, 
and once you see it, 
you can't go back.

1812
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:33,174
-It is what it is. 
-I can't go back, and for me, 
it was added baggage

1813
01:33:33,207 --> 01:33:35,876
that this is so ingrained 
in the culture that I came from.

1814
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:38,813
[Irwin] Understand, 
we're forcing people, 
we're gonna legislate people

1815
01:33:38,846 --> 01:33:41,349
into very significant cultural, 
psychological laws.

1816
01:33:41,382 --> 01:33:43,951
-Now-- now, not equal to it. 
-I understand that and--

1817
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:46,721
'Cause one is symbolic-- 
I get it-- and one is...

1818
01:33:46,754 --> 01:33:48,823
-Yeah. 
-...feel-- so I'm not--

1819
01:33:48,856 --> 01:33:51,125
I'm trying to say it both-- 
I hope you're hearing it.

1820
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:53,961
-I hear it. You're doing a 
wonderful-- an amazing job. 
-Yeah. Okay.

1821
01:33:53,995 --> 01:33:57,198
You know it's gonna-- social-- 
-[Levitt] Someone said to me--

1822
01:33:57,231 --> 01:33:59,266
Human rights are irrepressible.

1823
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,302
[Levitt] 
I had some interesting 
conversations with him.

1824
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:03,804
He's encouraged me 
to speak from my heart 
without hate,

1825
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:06,007
so in some way, 
he's sitting here with me

1826
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:09,410
as I'm talking now, 
'cause I can get really 
angry about this subject.

1827
01:34:12,213 --> 01:34:14,215
[man] 
So, what was the ruling?

1828
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:18,786
Very unfortunate, 
and it has been stricken 
from the election cycle.

1829
01:34:18,819 --> 01:34:21,322
We were pulled off the ballot.

1830
01:34:21,355 --> 01:34:24,725
so people would not 
get a chance to vote 
on it or discuss it.

1831
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:29,063
This is a long battle. 
Marilyn Milos here has 
devoted her life

1832
01:34:29,096 --> 01:34:31,232
to protecting infants from this,

1833
01:34:31,265 --> 01:34:36,037
and we are going 
to carry forward with all 
of the work she's done

1834
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:38,272
and add to it and expand.

1835
01:34:44,545 --> 01:34:49,050
It permeates... 
so much of our culture,

1836
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:51,886
and we don't talk about it. 
It's very painful

1837
01:34:51,919 --> 01:34:56,190
to... work on this issue

1838
01:34:56,223 --> 01:34:59,860
in that environment, 
in an environment

1839
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:04,165
where we joke 
about the feelings of men

1840
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:07,301
who are being vocal 
about their displeasure.

1841
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:10,004
And you'll hear someone say,

1842
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:12,139
"Well, they're-- 
they're in the fringe.

1843
01:35:12,173 --> 01:35:16,377
They're-- the majority 
of guys are fine with this."

1844
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:20,247
So, those who speak out 
get blasted...

1845
01:35:21,282 --> 01:35:23,851
and those who don't, 
suffer in silence...

1846
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:29,957
and potentially perpetrate 
the same horrific act on 
their own children.

1847
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:32,526
So, the cycle continues.

1848
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:38,299
[man] What would you say 
to men who are angry that 
they were circumcised?

1849
01:35:38,332 --> 01:35:42,002
-Yeah. What do I say? 
What do I say to 'em? 
-[man] I'm just curious.

1850
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:45,072
I'd s-- I'd say, "Get a life!"

1851
01:35:45,106 --> 01:35:47,808
I'd say, "Come on. I mean,

1852
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:50,911
"there's 120 million males 
in this country

1853
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:54,482
"that have been circumcised 
and are perfectly fine.

1854
01:35:54,515 --> 01:35:57,318
Go find another reason 
for your problems."

1855
01:35:58,552 --> 01:36:00,421
That's what I'd tell 'em.

1856
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:03,491
Three of my sons 
suffered mutil-- torture 
and mutilation...

1857
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:07,194
because some doctor lied to me.

1858
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:09,864
If I stopped doing this work-- 
oh, I'm gonna cry--

1859
01:36:09,897 --> 01:36:12,366
if I-- if I stopped 
doing this work--

1860
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:16,070
I think about my babies 
on that board, so...

1861
01:36:17,304 --> 01:36:20,608
How do you apologize 
to children for doing this?

1862
01:36:20,641 --> 01:36:24,044
How could you possibly say 
enough "I'm sorrys"?

1863
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:29,383
You can't, so I do the work,

1864
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,852
and-- and in that 
is the healing.

1865
01:36:31,886 --> 01:36:33,587
I don't know. It's not healing.

1866
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:35,923
I don't-- 
you don't get over this.

1867
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:37,091
You don't get over it...

1868
01:36:38,058 --> 01:36:39,593
but you can make a difference.

1869
01:36:42,096 --> 01:36:45,466
[babbles, laughs] 
I need to stop for 
a second for this.

1870
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:53,407
[Morris] 
Marilyn Milos was interviewed 
several years ago.

1871
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,243
and she came across 
as a weepy...

1872
01:36:58,546 --> 01:37:01,549
People who saw it-- 
I didn't-- I mean, I just 
felt sorry for her.

1873
01:37:01,582 --> 01:37:03,551
She had boys, 
she had them circumcised

1874
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:05,219
and it was probably done 
without anesthetic.

1875
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:06,987
That's where 
she's coming from, I guess--

1876
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:09,056
all emotional. Not good.

1877
01:37:09,089 --> 01:37:12,626
[Marilyn] I didn't 
start out as a crusader 
or as an Intactivist.

1878
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,929
I just started out thinking 
I was gonna hold the light,

1879
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:17,298
and everybody would be saying, 
"Oh good, we don't have to."

1880
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:21,468
I had no idea, the emotional 
attachment people have, even 
to something so sick.

1881
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:24,672
Somebody said to me, "Why you?" 
And I said, "Because I heard 
the scream of the baby."

1882
01:37:24,705 --> 01:37:27,341
He said, "Do you know 
how many millions of people 
have heard that scream?"

1883
01:37:27,374 --> 01:37:29,310
I said, "Well, then the 
question is, 'Why not them?'

1884
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:31,512
[chuckles] 
"Why did it take till me?

1885
01:37:31,545 --> 01:37:35,249
You know? Why didn't everybody 
stand up and scream?"

1886
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:40,988
[William] 
Real social change isn't 
doing something grandiose.

1887
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:44,058
Real social change is going out 
and changing people's minds.

1888
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:47,528
I've seen my friends 
ideas spread throughout 
the population.

1889
01:37:47,561 --> 01:37:51,165
When I first got into it, 
we were still a fringe movement, 
and now it's everywhere.

1890
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:53,334
And it all started out 
with a handful of people

1891
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:55,469
just going out there 
and passionately speaking.

1892
01:37:55,502 --> 01:37:59,406

This is a huge activist cause, 
and we will win.

1893
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:02,509
We are winning. This is 
the human rights issue 
of the 21st century,

1894
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:04,478
the American human rights issue.

1895
01:38:04,511 --> 01:38:09,083
The way we treat our baby boys 
is kind of the last stand here.

1896
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:13,153
Our culture is shaped 
by what we do to boys, 
affected by it forever.

1897
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:15,256
Ultimately, we'll look 
back and we'll say,

1898
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:18,692
"We used to do that?" 
And I look forward to that day.

1899
