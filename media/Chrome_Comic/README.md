## About the Chrome Comic <a hef="http://www.scottmccloud.com/">

In 2008, I created a comic book for Google explaining the inner workings of their new open source browser Google Chrome.
The comic itself became a Web phenomenon when it shipped ahead of the browser and for two days was the only source of information about this major software release throughout the world.&nbsp;&#45;&nbsp;Scott McCloud
