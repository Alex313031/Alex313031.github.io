A Minesweeper clone by [Jon Ziebell](https://github.com/ziebelje/)

Try it [as part of 98](https://98.js.org/) or [standalone](https://98.js.org/programs/minesweeper/)


### TODO

* [Add win condition](https://github.com/ziebelje/minesweeper/issues/1)

* [Never hit a mine on first click](https://github.com/ziebelje/minesweeper/issues/2)

* [Add middle click as an alternative to right+left click together](https://github.com/ziebelje/minesweeper/issues/5)

* Don't start the timer until you click a tile (left click; left+right click also starts the timer even tho it doesn't uncover any tiles)

* Don't let the player switch the mine that's highlighted after the game is over, or reset the display of incorrectly flagged mines
