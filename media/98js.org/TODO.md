# ![](images/icons/shutdown-32x32.png) Todo

* Add more libraries to CREDITS.txt, and possibly include (or at least mention) licenses

* *Properly* link to the repo from within the app, not just with a URL in a virtual text file

* Start Menu

	* Aria attributes

	* "Legitimate content"

* File save and open dialogs

* Integrate Paint better

	* Windows that pop out; will need to display graphics via data URIs or canvases, and rely only on inline styles (or `<style scoped>`?) and the shared styles

		* Could *maybe* use [`<base>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) for `<img>`s, but all styles (that aren't shared) would have to be inline, and I think it would be better just to try to make everything canvases

* Integrate Blue Screen of Death similar to http://fakebsod.com/generic

	* Press <kbd>~</kbd> or something to bluescreen

	* Prankily wait for next user input before fullscreening and bluescreening

* Try integrating arbitrary applications by emulating Windows 98 on the webpage [with v86](https://github.com/copy/v86/blob/master/docs/api.md),
with an X server installed in the VM, and acting as an X client externally??
And integrating a virtual filesystem??
That would be undoubtedly cool, but idk how hard it might be,
and especially what data channels are available between the VM and the host.
